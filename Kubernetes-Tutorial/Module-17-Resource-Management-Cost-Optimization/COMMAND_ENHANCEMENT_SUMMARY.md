## **üèÜ QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS ACHIEVED**

### **Command Documentation Enhancement**
```bash
# BEFORE (Insufficient):
kubectl top nodes

# AFTER (Golden Standard):
# COMMAND EXPLANATION:
# This command queries metrics-server to retrieve current resource consumption 
# for all nodes. Essential for understanding cluster capacity utilization.

kubectl top nodes

# EXPECTED OUTPUT:
NAME           CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
master-node    250m         12%    1.2Gi          15%

# OUTPUT EXPLANATION:
# - CPU(cores): Current usage in millicores (1000m = 1 core)
# - CPU%: Percentage of allocatable CPU being used

# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# - No output: metrics-server not installed
# - High percentages: Consider resource optimization
```

### **YAML Manifest Enhancement**
```bash
# BEFORE (Insufficient):
kubectl apply -f resourcequota.yaml

# AFTER (Golden Standard):
# COMMAND EXPLANATION:
# This creates a ResourceQuota to enforce namespace-level resource limits,
# preventing resource exhaustion and enabling cost control.

# WHAT THIS ACCOMPLISHES:
# 1. Enforces CPU limits (20 cores requests, 40 cores limits)
# 2. Controls memory allocation (40Gi requests, 80Gi limits)
# 3. Manages storage consumption and object counts

kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
# ... detailed YAML with line-by-line comments
EOF

# EXPECTED OUTPUT:
resourcequota/ecommerce-prod-quota created

# VERIFICATION:
kubectl describe resourcequota ecommerce-prod-quota -n ecommerce-prod

# EXPECTED VERIFICATION OUTPUT:
# ... complete expected output with explanations
```

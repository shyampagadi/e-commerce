## üéØ **Project Overview**

### **Project Name**
E-commerce Foundation Infrastructure Project

### **Project Purpose**
Establish a robust, scalable, and production-ready foundation infrastructure for the e-commerce platform using Kubernetes container orchestration, comprehensive monitoring, and enterprise-grade security practices.

### **Business Justification**
The current e-commerce platform lacks a modern, containerized infrastructure that can scale efficiently and provide reliable service delivery. This project addresses critical business needs:

- **Scalability**: Support growing customer base and transaction volume
- **Reliability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime for revenue-generating applications
- **Security**: Implement enterprise-grade security controls and compliance
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduce infrastructure costs through efficient resource utilization
- **Developer Productivity**: Enable faster deployment and development cycles

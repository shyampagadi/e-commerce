I'm working on a comprehensive Kubernetes tutorial that follows the Module 7 Golden Standard. Here are the essential files:



This tutorial follows these non-negotiable requirements:
- Module 7 Golden Standard compliance (35-point quality checklist)
- Complete newbie to expert coverage (4 progressive levels)
- VERY DETAILED SOLUTIONS for all practice problems and projects
- Complete command flag coverage for every command (3-tier system)
- Line-by-line YAML explanations for all configurations
- Chaos engineering integration throughout (minimum 3 experiments)
- E-commerce project integration in all examples
- Comprehensive prerequisites framework for every module
- Enterprise-grade assessment framework
- Production-ready security and monitoring patterns

Current Progress: Modules 0-9 completed with Golden Standard compliance.

Please create Module 10:  following the integrated Golden Standard process:
- Use Module 7 as the exact structural template
- Integrate all 35 quality points during creation (not after)
- Follow the 4-phase creation process (Planning, Content, Quality Integration, Validation)
- Ensure 100% compliance with all Golden Standard requirements
- Include comprehensive prerequisites, terminology, and assessment framework

also create a todo list which has all the validation and quality checks for the module

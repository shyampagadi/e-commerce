# GITHUB ACTIONS CI/CD WORKFLOW - COMPREHENSIVE DEVOPS PIPELINE DOCUMENTATION
# =============================================================================
# This file defines the GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for the Spring PetClinic
# microservices application. The workflow implements continuous integration and
# deployment practices with automated validation, building, testing, and
# deployment stages for reliable software delivery.
#
# DEVOPS PHILOSOPHY: This workflow embodies the principles of continuous
# integration and continuous deployment, enabling rapid, reliable, and
# repeatable software delivery through automation and quality gates.
#
# OPERATIONAL IMPACT: This CI/CD pipeline directly controls the quality and
# reliability of code deployments, making it a critical component for
# development velocity and production stability.

#    strategy:
#      matrix:
#        java-version: [17, 21]
#        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
#
# 3. CONDITIONAL EXECUTION:
#    if: contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[skip ci]') == false
#
# MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY:
#
# 1. WORKFLOW METRICS:
#    # Track build success rates
#    # Monitor deployment frequency
#    # Measure lead time for changes
#    # Analyze failure recovery time
#
# 2. NOTIFICATION INTEGRATION:
#    - name: Notify Slack on failure
#      if: failure()
#      uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3

#
# SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
#
# 1. SECRET MANAGEMENT:
#    # Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
#    # Rotate secrets regularly
#    # Limit secret access scope
#    # Audit secret usage
#
# 2. PERMISSION MANAGEMENT:
#    permissions:
#      contents: read
#      packages: write
#      security-events: write
#
# COMPLIANCE AND GOVERNANCE:
# - Workflow audit logging through GitHub Actions logs
# - Deployment approval processes for production
# - Change management integration
# - Compliance reporting and documentation
# - Regular security and dependency updates

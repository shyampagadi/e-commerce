# Shell Script Function Documentation Template

## **Project 1 Golden Standard Documentation Pattern**

This template provides the exact documentation pattern used in Project 1 that should be applied to all functions in Project 2 shell scripts.

### **Function Header Documentation Pattern:**

```bash
# Function: [Function Name]
function_name() {
    # =============================================================================
    # [FUNCTION NAME] FUNCTION
    # =============================================================================
    # [Brief description of what the function does with comprehensive
    # capabilities and purpose explanation].
    # =============================================================================
    
    # Purpose: [What the function accomplishes]
    # Why needed: [Business/technical justification for the function]
    # Impact: [What happens when this function is executed]
    # Parameters: [List of parameters with descriptions]
    # Usage: [Example usage]
    
    local variable_name=$1
    # Purpose: [What this variable stores]
    # Why needed: [Why this variable is required]
    # Impact: [What happens when this variable is used]
    # Parameter: [Parameter description if applicable]
    
    # =============================================================================
    # [SECTION NAME]
    # =============================================================================
    # Purpose: [What this section accomplishes]
    # Why needed: [Why this section is required]
    
    if [ condition ]; then
        # Purpose: [What this condition checks]
        # Why needed: [Why this check is necessary]
        # Impact: [What happens if condition is true]
        
        command
        # Purpose: [What this command does]
        # Why needed: [Why this command is needed]
        # Impact: [What happens when command executes]
        # [Additional command-specific details]
    fi
    
    # =============================================================================
    # [ANOTHER SECTION]
    # =============================================================================
    # Purpose: [Section purpose]
    # Why needed: [Section justification]
    
    for item in $list; do
        # Purpose: [What this loop does]
        # Why needed: [Why iteration is needed]
        # Impact: [What happens in each iteration]
        
        command
        # Purpose: [Command purpose]
        # Why needed: [Command justification]
        # Impact: [Command impact]
    done
    
    return 0
    # Purpose: [Why returning this value]
    # Why needed: [Return value justification]
    # Impact: [What the return value indicates]
}
```

### **Key Documentation Elements:**

1. **Function Header Block:**
   - Function name in caps
   - Comprehensive description
   - Purpose, Why needed, Impact, Parameters, Usage

2. **Local Variable Documentation:**
   - Purpose: What the variable stores
   - Why needed: Why this variable is required
   - Impact: What happens when used
   - Parameter: Description if applicable

3. **Section Headers:**
   - Clear section names in caps
   - Purpose and Why needed for each section

4. **Command Documentation:**
   - Purpose: What the command does
   - Why needed: Why this command is necessary
   - Impact: What happens when executed
   - Additional details: Flags, parameters, etc.

5. **Conditional Logic Documentation:**
   - Purpose: What the condition checks
   - Why needed: Why the check is necessary
   - Impact: What happens if true/false

6. **Loop Documentation:**
   - Purpose: What the loop accomplishes
   - Why needed: Why iteration is required
   - Impact: What happens in each iteration

### **Documentation Standards:**

- **Every line** that does something meaningful needs documentation
- **Purpose, Why needed, Impact** for every element
- **Section headers** for logical groupings
- **Command flags and parameters** explained
- **Error handling** documented
- **Return values** explained
- **Variable usage** documented

### **Example Application:**

```bash
# Function: Check pod health
check_pod_health() {
    # =============================================================================
    # CHECK POD HEALTH FUNCTION
    # =============================================================================
    # Validates the health status of a specific pod with comprehensive
    # health checks including readiness, liveness, and resource validation.
    # =============================================================================
    
    local pod_name=$1
    # Purpose: Specifies the name of the pod to check
    # Why needed: Identifies which pod to perform health validation on
    # Impact: Function targets this specific pod for health checks
    # Parameter: $1 is the pod name (e.g., "backend-pod-123")
    
    # =============================================================================
    # POD EXISTENCE VALIDATION
    # =============================================================================
    # Purpose: Verify the pod exists before performing health checks
    # Why needed: Prevents errors when checking non-existent pods
    
    if ! kubectl get pod "$pod_name" -n "$NAMESPACE" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        # Purpose: Check if pod exists in the namespace
        # Why needed: Validates pod existence before health checks
        # Impact: If pod doesn't exist, health check cannot proceed
        # >/dev/null 2>&1: Suppresses output, only checks exit code
        
        print_status "ERROR" "Pod $pod_name not found"
        # Purpose: Log error message about missing pod
        # Why needed: Informs user that pod doesn't exist
        # Impact: User knows the pod name is incorrect or pod is deleted
        
        return 1
        # Purpose: Exit function with error code 1
        # Why needed: Indicates pod health check failure
        # Impact: Function terminates with error status
    fi
    
    # =============================================================================
    # POD READINESS CHECK
    # =============================================================================
    # Purpose: Verify pod is ready to serve traffic
    # Why needed: Ensures pod can handle requests before marking as healthy
    
    local ready_status
    # Purpose: Variable to store pod readiness status
    # Why needed: Provides status information for health determination
    # Impact: Used to determine if pod is ready for traffic
    
    ready_status=$(kubectl get pod "$pod_name" -n "$NAMESPACE" -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].status}')
    # Purpose: Extract pod readiness condition status
    # Why needed: Determines if pod is ready to serve traffic
    # Impact: Provides boolean status of pod readiness
    # jsonpath: Extracts specific field from pod status JSON
    
    if [ "$ready_status" != "True" ]; then
        # Purpose: Check if pod is not ready
        # Why needed: Identifies pods that cannot serve traffic
        # Impact: If pod not ready, health check fails
        
        print_status "WARNING" "Pod $pod_name is not ready (status: $ready_status)"
        # Purpose: Log warning about pod readiness
        # Why needed: Informs user about pod readiness issue
        # Impact: User knows pod is not ready for traffic
        
        return 1
        # Purpose: Exit function with error code 1
        # Why needed: Indicates pod health check failure
        # Impact: Function terminates with error status
    fi
    
    print_status "SUCCESS" "Pod $pod_name is healthy and ready"
    # Purpose: Log success message for healthy pod
    # Why needed: Confirms pod is healthy and ready
    # Impact: User knows pod health check passed
    
    return 0
    # Purpose: Exit function with success code 0
    # Why needed: Indicates successful pod health check
    # Impact: Function completes successfully with healthy pod
}
```

### **Scripts to Update:**

1. **`scripts/deploy.sh`** - ‚úÖ COMPLETED (13 functions)
2. **`scripts/operate.sh`** - üîÑ IN PROGRESS (3 functions done, 15 remaining)
3. **`scripts/monitor.sh`** - ‚ùå PENDING (21 functions)
4. **`scripts/backup.sh`** - ‚ùå PENDING (21 functions)
5. **`validation/health-check.sh`** - ‚ùå PENDING (10 functions)
6. **`validation/performance-test.sh`** - ‚ùå PENDING (8 functions)
7. **`validation/run-tests.sh`** - ‚ùå PENDING (10 functions)
8. **`validation/validate-monitoring-stack.sh`** - ‚ùå PENDING (5 functions)

### **Total Functions Remaining: 90+**

### **Estimated Time: 12-15 hours for complete documentation**

### **Recommendation:**
Apply this template systematically to all functions, focusing on the most critical scripts first (deploy.sh ‚úÖ, operate.sh, health-check.sh).

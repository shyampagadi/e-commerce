### 2. Metrics and Reporting

#### Purpose
Provide procedures for tracking and reporting chaos engineering metrics.

#### Why This Process is Needed
Ensures that chaos engineering effectiveness is measured and reported.

#### Impact
- **Performance Measurement**: Measures chaos engineering performance
- **Improvement Tracking**: Tracks improvements over time
- **Compliance Reporting**: Provides compliance reporting
- **Management Reporting**: Provides management reporting

#### Steps
1. **Collect Metrics**
   ```bash
   # Collect experiment metrics
   grep "Duration:" /tmp/experiment-reports/*.md
   grep "Status:" /tmp/experiment-reports/*.md
   grep "Issues:" /tmp/experiment-reports/*.md
   ```

2. **Generate Reports**
   ```bash
   # Generate monthly report
   cat > /tmp/monthly-report.md << 'EOF'
   # Chaos Engineering Monthly Report
   
   ## Summary
   - **Total Experiments**: [TOTAL_EXPERIMENTS]
   - **Successful Experiments**: [SUCCESSFUL_EXPERIMENTS]
   - **Failed Experiments**: [FAILED_EXPERIMENTS]
   - **Success Rate**: [SUCCESS_RATE]%
   
   ## Key Metrics
   - **Average Recovery Time**: [AVERAGE_RECOVERY_TIME]
   - **Issues Discovered**: [ISSUES_DISCOVERED]
   - **Improvements Implemented**: [IMPROVEMENTS]
   
   ## Trends
   - **Recovery Time Trend**: [TREND]
   - **Issue Discovery Trend**: [TREND]
   - **Success Rate Trend**: [TREND]
   
   ## Recommendations
   - [RECOMMENDATION_1]
   - [RECOMMENDATION_2]
   - [RECOMMENDATION_3]
   EOF
   ```

3. **Share Reports**
   ```bash
   # Share reports with team
   mail -s "Chaos Engineering Monthly Report" team@company.com < /tmp/monthly-report.md
   
   # Share reports with management
   mail -s "Chaos Engineering Monthly Report" management@company.com < /tmp/monthly-report.md
   ```

#### Validation Criteria
- Metrics are collected regularly
- Reports are generated
- Reports are shared with stakeholders
- Improvements are tracked

## Conclusion

This runbook provides comprehensive procedures for executing chaos engineering experiments safely and effectively. It serves as the operational guide for conducting chaos experiments on the e-commerce application.

The key to successful chaos engineering is:
- **Follow Procedures**: Follow all procedures exactly
- **Safety First**: Always prioritize system safety
- **Document Everything**: Document all findings and procedures
- **Learn Continuously**: Learn from each experiment
- **Improve Processes**: Continuously improve processes

Remember: **The goal is not to break the system, but to make it stronger through controlled failure testing.**

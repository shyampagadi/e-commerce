# Chaos Engineering for E-commerce Application

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive chaos engineering experiments designed to test the resilience and reliability of the e-commerce application deployed on Kubernetes. These experiments follow enterprise-grade standards and provide detailed documentation for each chaos scenario.

## Purpose

Chaos engineering is the practice of intentionally introducing failures and disruptions to test system resilience, identify weaknesses, and improve overall system reliability. This is critical for production-ready applications to ensure they can handle real-world failures gracefully.

## Why Chaos Engineering is Needed

- **Resilience Testing**: Validate that the application can recover from failures
- **Weakness Identification**: Discover single points of failure and bottlenecks
- **Confidence Building**: Build confidence in system reliability before production
- **Disaster Recovery**: Test backup and recovery procedures
- **Performance Under Stress**: Validate performance under various failure conditions
- **Monitoring Validation**: Ensure monitoring and alerting systems work correctly

## Impact

Proper chaos engineering provides:
- **Improved Reliability**: Systems that have been tested under failure conditions
- **Reduced Downtime**: Faster recovery from failures due to tested procedures
- **Better Monitoring**: Validated alerting and monitoring systems
- **Team Preparedness**: Teams trained to handle various failure scenarios
- **Production Readiness**: Confidence in system stability

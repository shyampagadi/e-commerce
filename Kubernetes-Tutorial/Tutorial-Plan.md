#### **8. Performance and Security Considerations**
```bash
# Performance Considerations:
echo "=== PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS ==="
echo "1. Use specific flags to reduce output size:"
echo "   - Use -o to specify only needed columns"
echo "   - Use --no-headers for scripting"
echo "   - Use --sort to organize output efficiently"
echo ""
echo "2. Optimize for large systems:"
echo "   - Use --pid to filter by specific process IDs"
echo "   - Use --user to filter by specific users"
echo "   - Use --tty to filter by terminal type"
echo ""

# Security Considerations:
echo "=== SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS ==="
echo "1. Be careful with -a flag (shows all users' processes):"
echo "   - May expose sensitive information"
echo "   - Use -u to filter by specific users"
echo "   - Use --pid to filter by specific process IDs"
echo ""
echo "2. Command line exposure:"
echo "   - -f flag shows full command line (may contain passwords)"
echo "   - Be aware of sensitive information in command lines"
echo "   - Use -o to control which fields are displayed"
echo ""
echo "3. Process information security:"
echo "   - Process IDs can be used for process injection attacks"
echo "   - Be cautious when sharing process information"
echo "   - Use appropriate filtering to limit information exposure"
echo ""
```

#### **9. Troubleshooting Scenarios**
```bash
# Common Issues and Solutions:
echo "=== TROUBLESHOOTING SCENARIOS ==="
echo ""
echo "1. Command not found:"
echo "   Problem: 'ps: command not found'"
echo "   Solution: Install procps package"
echo "   Command: sudo apt install procps"
echo ""
echo "2. Permission denied:"
echo "   Problem: Cannot see other users' processes"
echo "   Solution: Use sudo or check user permissions"
echo "   Command: sudo ps -ef"
echo ""
echo "3. No output:"
echo "   Problem: ps command returns no results"
echo "   Solution: Check if processes are running"
echo "   Command: ps aux | wc -l"
echo ""
echo "4. High CPU usage:"
echo "   Problem: System is slow, need to identify resource-heavy processes"
echo "   Solution: Use CPU sorting"
echo "   Command: ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10"
echo ""
```

#### **10. Complete Code Documentation (NEW REQUIREMENT)**

# Parameters: 
#   - level: Log level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
#   - message: Message to log
# Return: None (writes to log file)
# Usage: log_message "INFO" "Starting backup process"

log_message() {
    local level="$1"        # First parameter: log level
    local message="$2"      # Second parameter: message content
    local timestamp=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')  # Get current timestamp
    echo "[$timestamp] [$level] $message" | tee -a "$LOG_DIR/automation.log"
    # tee -a: Append to log file while also displaying on screen
}

# Script Documentation Example:
# Script: system_automation.sh
# Purpose: Comprehensive system automation using Linux commands
# Dependencies: bash, coreutils, procps, findutils
# Usage: ./system_automation.sh [options]

# Variable Documentation:
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
# Explanation: Get absolute path of script directory
# - cd: Change to script's directory
# - dirname: Get directory name from script path
# - BASH_SOURCE[0]: Path to current script
# - pwd: Print working directory (absolute path)

# Command-by-Command Breakdown:
find "$source_dir" -type f -name "*.txt" -exec cp {} "$target_dir/text_files/" \; 2>/dev/null
# Explanation:
# - find: Search for files
# - "$source_dir": Starting directory for search
# - -type f: Only regular files (not directories)
# - -name "*.txt": Files with .txt extension
# - -exec cp {} "$target_dir/text_files/" \;: Execute cp command for each found file

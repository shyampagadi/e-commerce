# Architecture Pattern Selection Decision Matrix

## Overview
This decision matrix helps select the appropriate architecture pattern based on project requirements and constraints.

## Decision Matrix

| Requirement | Monolithic | Microservices | Serverless | Hybrid |
|-------------|------------|---------------|------------|--------|
| **Team Size** | Small (1-5) | Large (10+) | Small-Medium | Variable |
| **System Complexity** | Low-Medium | High | Low | Medium-High |
| **Scalability Needs** | Limited | High | Auto | High |
| **Development Speed** | Fast | Slow | Fast | Medium |
| **Operational Overhead** | Low | High | Very Low | Medium |
| **Cost (Small Scale)** | Low | High | Low | Medium |
| **Cost (Large Scale)** | High | Medium | Variable | Medium |
| **Technology Flexibility** | Low | High | Medium | High |
| **Deployment Complexity** | Simple | Complex | Simple | Medium |
| **Debugging Difficulty** | Easy | Hard | Medium | Medium |

## Scoring System
- ✅ **Excellent (3 points)**: Fully meets requirements
- ⚠️ **Possible/Limited (2 points)**: Partially meets requirements  
- ❌ **No/Poor (1 point)**: Does not meet requirements

## Decision Guide

### Choose Monolithic When:
- Small team (1-5 developers)
- Simple requirements and well-defined scope
- Fast time-to-market needed
- Limited operational expertise
- Predictable, stable traffic patterns

### Choose Microservices When:
- Large team (10+ developers)
- Complex domain with clear service boundaries
- Independent scaling requirements
- Different technology stacks needed
- High availability and fault isolation required

### Choose Serverless When:
- Event-driven workloads
- Variable or unpredictable traffic
- Minimal operational overhead desired
- Pay-per-use cost model preferred
- Rapid prototyping and experimentation

### Choose Hybrid When:
- Mixed requirements across different components
- Gradual migration from monolithic to microservices
- Different services have different operational needs
- Legacy system integration required
- Risk mitigation through incremental adoption

## Example Decision Process

1. **Assess Requirements**: Score each criterion (1-3 points)
2. **Calculate Totals**: Sum scores for each architecture pattern
3. **Consider Constraints**: Factor in team expertise, timeline, budget
4. **Make Decision**: Choose highest-scoring pattern that meets constraints
5. **Document Rationale**: Record decision reasoning for future reference

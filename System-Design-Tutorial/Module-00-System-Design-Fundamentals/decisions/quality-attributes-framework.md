# ADR-00-003: Quality Attributes Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Architectural decisions significantly impact non-functional requirements (quality attributes). Without a systematic framework for evaluating and prioritizing these attributes, decisions may not align with business needs and stakeholder expectations.

## Decision
Implement a comprehensive Quality Attributes Decision Framework based on stakeholder value analysis and trade-off evaluation.

## Quality Attributes Decision Framework

### Primary Decision Question
**"Which quality attributes provide the highest business value for our specific context?"**

### Quality Attributes Prioritization Matrix
| Quality Attribute | Business Impact | User Impact | Technical Risk | Implementation Cost | Priority Score |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Performance | High (9) | High (9) | Medium (6) | Medium (6) | **7.5** |
| Security | High (9) | High (8) | Low (8) | Medium (6) | **7.8** |
| Scalability | High (8) | Medium (7) | Medium (6) | High (4) | **6.3** |
| Reliability | High (9) | High (9) | Low (8) | Medium (6) | **8.0** |
| Maintainability | Medium (6) | Low (4) | Low (8) | Medium (6) | **6.0** |
| Usability | Medium (7) | High (9) | Low (8) | Low (8) | **8.0** |

**Scoring**: 1-3 (Low), 4-6 (Medium), 7-9 (High)

### Quality Attributes Trade-off Analysis

#### Performance vs Security Trade-off Matrix
| Security Level | Performance Impact | Acceptable Scenarios | Mitigation Strategies |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Basic | Minimal (< 5%) | Public content, low-risk data | Optimize algorithms |
| Standard | Moderate (5-15%) | Business applications | Hardware acceleration |
| High | Significant (15-30%) | Financial, healthcare | Dedicated security hardware |
| Maximum | Severe (> 30%) | Military, classified | Accept performance cost |

#### Scalability vs Complexity Trade-off Matrix
| Scalability Need | Complexity Increase | Team Size Requirement | Decision Threshold |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 2x growth | Low | Current team | Proceed |
| 5x growth | Medium | +2-3 developers | Evaluate carefully |
| 10x growth | High | +5-8 developers | Requires strong justification |
| 100x growth | Very High | Dedicated team | Only if business critical |

### Quality Attributes Decision Trees

#### Performance Decision Tree
```
Performance Requirements Assessment
├── Response Time < 100ms?
│   ├── Yes → Consider caching strategies
│   └── No → Evaluate if < 1s acceptable
├── Throughput > 10k RPS?
│   ├── Yes → Horizontal scaling required
│   └── No → Vertical scaling sufficient
└── Global Users?
    ├── Yes → CDN and regional deployment
    └── No → Single region deployment
```

#### Security Decision Tree
```
Security Requirements Assessment
├── Sensitive Data (PII, Financial)?
│   ├── Yes → Encryption mandatory
│   └── No → Basic security sufficient
├── Regulatory Compliance Required?
│   ├── Yes → Audit trail + compliance controls
│   └── No → Standard security practices
└── External API Access?
    ├── Yes → Authentication + rate limiting
    └── No → Internal security controls
```

## Quality Attributes Evaluation Framework

### Stakeholder Value Analysis
| Stakeholder | Performance | Security | Scalability | Reliability | Usability |
|-------------|-------------|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| End Users | Critical | Important | Neutral | Critical | Critical |
| Business | Important | Critical | Important | Critical | Important |
| Operations | Important | Important | Critical | Critical | Neutral |
| Developers | Neutral | Important | Important | Important | Important |
| **Weighted Priority** | **High** | **Critical** | **Important** | **Critical** | **Important** |

### Quality Attributes Measurement Framework
| Quality Attribute | Measurement Method | Target Threshold | Monitoring Approach |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Performance | Response time, throughput | < 200ms, > 5k RPS | Real-time monitoring |
| Security | Vulnerability count, incidents | Zero critical, < 2 incidents/year | Security scanning |
| Scalability | Load capacity, growth rate | 10x current load | Load testing |
| Reliability | Uptime, MTBF | 99.9%, > 720 hours | Availability monitoring |
| Maintainability | Code complexity, change time | < 10 cyclomatic, < 2 days | Code analysis |

## Decision Support Models

### Quality Attributes Cost-Benefit Analysis
| Quality Attribute | Implementation Cost | Maintenance Cost | Business Value | ROI Score |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| High Performance | High | Medium | High | 7/10 |
| Advanced Security | Medium | High | Very High | 8/10 |
| Extreme Scalability | Very High | Very High | Medium | 4/10 |
| High Reliability | Medium | Medium | High | 8/10 |
| Enhanced Usability | Medium | Low | High | 9/10 |

### Risk Assessment Matrix
| Quality Attribute | Risk of Not Implementing | Probability | Impact | Risk Score |
|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Performance | User abandonment | High | High | 9 |
| Security | Data breach | Medium | Very High | 8 |
| Scalability | Growth limitation | Medium | High | 6 |
| Reliability | Service outages | High | High | 9 |
| Maintainability | Technical debt | High | Medium | 6 |

## Rationale
This framework provides:
- **Objective Prioritization**: Data-driven quality attribute selection
- **Trade-off Visibility**: Clear understanding of competing priorities
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Transparent decision criteria
- **Risk Management**: Systematic risk assessment for quality decisions

## Consequences

### Positive
- Better alignment between technical decisions and business value
- Reduced conflicts over competing quality requirements
- More predictable system behavior and performance
- Improved stakeholder satisfaction

### Negative
- Additional complexity in decision-making process
- Potential over-analysis of quality requirements
- May constrain creative technical solutions
- Requires ongoing measurement and validation

## Alternatives Considered

### Single Quality Focus
- **Pros**: Simple prioritization, clear focus
- **Cons**: Neglects other important attributes
- **Decision**: Rejected - too narrow for complex systems

### Equal Priority for All Attributes
- **Pros**: Comprehensive coverage
- **Cons**: Resource constraints make this impractical
- **Decision**: Rejected - not feasible with limited resources

### Intuition-Based Prioritization
- **Pros**: Fast decisions, leverages experience
- **Cons**: Subjective, may miss stakeholder needs
- **Decision**: Rejected - too risky for critical systems

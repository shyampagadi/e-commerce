# Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Index

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document significant architectural decisions made during the system design process. ADRs provide a historical record of why decisions were made and help maintain consistency across the project.

## ADR Template

See [templates/ADR-TEMPLATE.md](templates/ADR-TEMPLATE.md) for the standard ADR format.

## ADR Status Legend

- **Proposed**: Decision is under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and implemented
- **Rejected**: Decision was considered but not adopted
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer current
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## ADR Guidelines

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions that:
- Affect multiple components or modules
- Have long-term architectural implications
- Involve significant trade-offs
- Impact system performance, security, or maintainability
- Require coordination across teams

### ADR Naming Convention

Format: `{Module-Number}-{Sequence-Number}-{Short-Description}.md`

Examples:
- `00-001-architecture-pattern-selection.md`
- `01-002-auto-scaling-strategy.md`
- `02-003-api-gateway-architecture.md`

### ADR Review Process

1. **Proposal**: Create ADR with "Proposed" status
2. **Review**: Team reviews and provides feedback
3. **Discussion**: Address concerns and refine decision
4. **Decision**: Update status to "Accepted" or "Rejected"
5. **Implementation**: Execute the decision
6. **Validation**: Verify decision meets requirements

### ADR Maintenance

- **Regular Reviews**: Quarterly review of all ADRs
- **Status Updates**: Keep status current with implementation
- **Deprecation**: Mark obsolete ADRs as "Deprecated"
- **Superseding**: Create new ADR when replacing old decisions

## Contributing

When creating a new ADR:

1. Copy the template from `templates/ADR-TEMPLATE.md`
2. Follow the naming convention
3. Fill in all required sections
4. Submit for team review
5. Update this index when ADR is accepted

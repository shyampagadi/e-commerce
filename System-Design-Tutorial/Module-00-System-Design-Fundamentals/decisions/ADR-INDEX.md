# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) - Module 00

## Overview
This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Module-00: System Design Fundamentals. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the system design process.

## ADR Status Legend
- **Proposed**: Decision is under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Current ADRs for Module-00

### ADR-00-001: Architecture Pattern Selection Framework
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Use systematic pattern selection framework for architectural decisions
- **Rationale**: Ensures consistent and well-reasoned architectural choices
- **File**: [architecture-pattern-selection.md](./architecture-pattern-selection.md)

### ADR-00-002: System Design Methodology
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Adopt structured system design methodology with requirements analysis
- **Rationale**: Provides systematic approach to complex system design challenges
- **File**: [system-design-methodology.md](./system-design-methodology.md)

### ADR-00-003: Quality Attributes Framework
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Use quality attributes as primary drivers for architectural decisions
- **Rationale**: Ensures non-functional requirements are properly addressed
- **File**: [quality-attributes-framework.md](./quality-attributes-framework.md)

### ADR-00-004: Documentation Standards
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Implement comprehensive documentation standards for all architectural decisions
- **Rationale**: Maintains knowledge and enables effective team collaboration
- **File**: [documentation-standards.md](./documentation-standards.md)

### ADR-00-005: Technology Evaluation Criteria
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Use standardized criteria for evaluating and selecting technologies
- **Rationale**: Ensures objective and consistent technology selection process
- **File**: [technology-evaluation-criteria.md](./technology-evaluation-criteria.md)

## Guidelines for Creating ADRs

### When to Create an ADR
- Fundamental architectural pattern decisions
- System design methodology choices
- Quality attribute prioritization decisions
- Documentation and process standards
- Technology evaluation frameworks

### ADR Template
Use the following template for new ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-00-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded]

## Context
[Background and problem statement]

## Decision
[The architectural decision made]

## Rationale
[Why this decision was made]

## Consequences
[Positive and negative consequences]

## Alternatives Considered
[Other options that were considered]

## Implementation Notes
[How to implement this decision]

## Related ADRs
[Links to related ADRs]
```

### Naming Convention
- Format: `ADR-00-XXX-descriptive-name.md`
- XXX: Three-digit number (001, 002, 003, etc.)
- Use kebab-case for descriptive name

## Review Process

### ADR Review Steps
1. **Draft**: Create ADR with proposed status
2. **Review**: Technical team reviews the ADR
3. **Discussion**: Address feedback and concerns
4. **Approval**: Change status to accepted
5. **Implementation**: Implement the decision
6. **Monitoring**: Monitor consequences and update if needed

# ADR-00-002: System Design Methodology

## Status
Accepted

## Context
System design projects require a structured decision-making approach to handle complexity and ensure comprehensive coverage of requirements. Without a standardized methodology, teams may miss critical aspects, make inconsistent decisions, or struggle with stakeholder alignment.

## Decision
Adopt a structured system design methodology based on decision-driven architecture with four key decision phases.

## Decision Framework

### Phase 1: Requirements Decision Framework
**Decision Question**: What are the true system requirements and constraints?

**Decision Criteria**:
- Business value impact (High/Medium/Low)
- Technical feasibility (Proven/Possible/Risky)
- Resource requirements (Available/Stretch/Unavailable)
- Timeline constraints (Flexible/Fixed/Critical)

**Decision Matrix**:
| Requirement Type | Business Impact | Technical Risk | Resource Need | Priority Score |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Functional Core | High | Proven | Available | 9 |
| Performance | High | Possible | Stretch | 7 |
| Scalability | Medium | Possible | Stretch | 6 |
| Security | High | Proven | Available | 9 |
| Usability | Medium | Proven | Available | 6 |

### Phase 2: Architecture Decision Framework
**Decision Question**: What architectural patterns best serve our requirements?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Complexity vs Benefit ratio
- Team expertise alignment
- Scalability requirements
- Maintenance overhead
- Risk tolerance

**Architecture Pattern Decision Tree**:
```
Start: System Complexity Assessment
├── Simple (< 5 components) → Monolithic Architecture
├── Moderate (5-20 components) → Modular Monolith
└── Complex (> 20 components) → Microservices
    ├── Team Size < 10 → Service-Oriented Architecture
    └── Team Size > 10 → Full Microservices
```

### Phase 3: Technology Decision Framework
**Decision Question**: Which technologies align with our architectural decisions?

**Technology Evaluation Matrix**:
| Criteria | Weight | Technology A | Technology B | Technology C |
|----------|--------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Team Expertise | 25% | 8/10 | 6/10 | 4/10 |
| Performance | 20% | 7/10 | 9/10 | 8/10 |
| Scalability | 20% | 6/10 | 8/10 | 9/10 |
| Cost | 15% | 9/10 | 6/10 | 7/10 |
| Community Support | 10% | 8/10 | 9/10 | 5/10 |
| Vendor Lock-in Risk | 10% | 7/10 | 5/10 | 8/10 |
| **Weighted Score** | | **7.4** | **7.3** | **6.9** |

### Phase 4: Validation Decision Framework
**Decision Question**: How do we validate our architectural decisions?

**Validation Decision Matrix**:
| Validation Method | Cost | Time | Confidence Level | Risk Mitigation |
|-------------------|------|------|------------------|-----------------|
| Proof of Concept | Medium | 2-4 weeks | High | High |
| Architecture Review | Low | 1 week | Medium | Medium |
| Prototype | High | 4-8 weeks | Very High | Very High |
| Simulation | Low | 1-2 weeks | Medium | Low |

## Rationale
This methodology provides:
- **Systematic Decision Making**: Structured approach to complex architectural choices
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Clear criteria for evaluating alternatives
- **Risk Mitigation**: Early identification of potential issues
- **Traceability**: Clear rationale for all major decisions

## Consequences

### Positive
- Reduced risk of architectural mismatch
- Better stakeholder buy-in through transparent decision process
- Improved team alignment on technical direction
- Clear audit trail for architectural decisions

### Negative
- Initial overhead in establishing decision frameworks
- Potential analysis paralysis if over-applied
- Requires discipline to follow consistently
- May slow initial development phases

## Alternatives Considered

### Agile Architecture Approach
- **Pros**: Flexible, responsive to change
- **Cons**: May lack comprehensive upfront planning
- **Decision**: Partially adopted - use iterative validation within structured phases

### Waterfall Architecture Approach
- **Pros**: Comprehensive upfront planning
- **Cons**: Less adaptable to changing requirements
- **Decision**: Rejected - too rigid for modern development

### Ad-hoc Decision Making
- **Pros**: Fast initial decisions
- **Cons**: Inconsistent quality, poor traceability
- **Decision**: Rejected - too risky for complex systems

## Decision Support Tools

### Stakeholder Analysis Matrix
| Stakeholder | Influence | Interest | Decision Impact | Engagement Strategy |
|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Business Owner | High | High | High | Collaborate |
| Development Team | Medium | High | High | Involve |
| Operations Team | Medium | Medium | Medium | Consult |
| End Users | Low | High | Medium | Inform |

### Risk Assessment Framework
| Risk Category | Probability | Impact | Risk Score | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|-------------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Technical | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | 1-9 | Prototype/PoC |
| Resource | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | 1-9 | Skill Development |
| Timeline | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | 1-9 | Scope Adjustment |
| Business | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | 1-9 | Stakeholder Alignment |

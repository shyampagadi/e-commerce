# ADR-00-005: Technology Evaluation Criteria

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our startup needs to select a web framework for a SaaS platform expecting 10K users in Year 1, growing to 100K users by Year 3. Team has 3 full-stack developers with varying experience levels. Budget is $50K annually for technology stack.

## Decision
Use systematic technology evaluation framework with concrete scoring criteria and real-world constraints to ensure objective technology selection.

## Technology Evaluation Decision Framework

### Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)
The evaluation uses weighted criteria based on business priorities:

**Criteria Weighting Rationale:**
- **Performance (25%)**: Critical for user experience and scalability
- **Team Skills (25%)**: Highest weight due to small team and limited training budget
- **Development Speed (20%)**: Important for competitive time-to-market
- **Scalability (15%)**: Medium priority given expected growth trajectory
- **Cost (10%)**: Lower weight as technology costs are small vs development costs
- **Community Support (5%)**: Lowest weight as team can handle most issues

### Scoring Methodology

#### Performance Scoring Criteria (1-10 scale)
- **10 points**: >5,000 RPS, <50ms response time
- **8-9 points**: 3,000-5,000 RPS, 50-80ms response time
- **6-7 points**: 2,000-3,000 RPS, 80-120ms response time
- **4-5 points**: 1,000-2,000 RPS, 120-200ms response time
- **1-3 points**: <1,000 RPS, >200ms response time

#### Team Fit Scoring Criteria (1-10 scale)
- **10 points**: All developers expert, no training needed
- **8-9 points**: Most developers proficient, minimal training (<$5K)
- **6-7 points**: Some developers proficient, moderate training ($5K-10K)
- **4-5 points**: Few developers proficient, extensive training ($10K-15K)
- **1-3 points**: No developers proficient, complete retraining (>$15K)

#### Cost Scoring Criteria (1-10 scale)
- **10 points**: Total 3-year cost <$30K
- **8-9 points**: Total 3-year cost $30K-50K
- **6-7 points**: Total 3-year cost $50K-80K
- **4-5 points**: Total 3-year cost $80K-120K
- **1-3 points**: Total 3-year cost >$120K

# Project 00-B: Architectural Decision Framework

## Project Overview
In this project, you will create a decision-making framework to guide architectural choices for your chosen system (the same one you analyzed in Project 00-A). This framework will be used throughout the system design process to evaluate options and document decisions.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn to create structured decision matrices for architecture choices
- Develop skills in trade-off analysis documentation
- Establish evaluation criteria for technology selection
- Practice creating architecture diagrams

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Project 00-A: System Requirements Analysis
- Understanding of architectural quality attributes
- Basic knowledge of decision-making frameworks

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Decision Matrix Template
1. Design a decision matrix template that includes:
   - Options to be evaluated
   - Evaluation criteria based on quality attributes
   - Weighting for different criteria
   - Scoring mechanism
   - Final scoring calculation
2. Create a standardized format for documenting decisions
3. Define a process for using the decision matrix

### Task 2: Trade-off Analysis Methodology
1. Document a methodology for analyzing trade-offs between competing quality attributes
2. Create templates for trade-off analysis documentation
3. Define a structured approach to weighing pros and cons
4. Establish a framework for documenting architectural compromises

### Task 3: Technology Selection Criteria
1. Define general criteria for evaluating technology options:
   - Alignment with quality attribute priorities
   - Maturity and industry adoption
   - Team expertise and learning curve
   - Integration with existing systems
   - Cost considerations
   - Support and community
2. Create technology-specific evaluation criteria for:
   - Compute infrastructure options
   - Database technologies
   - Messaging systems
   - Caching solutions

### Task 4: Component Interaction Diagram
1. Design an initial high-level component interaction diagram for your chosen system
2. Identify major system components based on requirements
3. Document interactions between components
4. Highlight potential architectural decision points

### Task 5: Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
1. Create an ADR template for documenting significant architectural decisions
2. Document the format for capturing:
   - Decision context
   - Options considered
   - Decision made
   - Rationale
   - Consequences
3. Create sample ADRs for initial architectural decisions

## Deliverables
1. Decision Matrix Template with Usage Guide
2. Trade-off Analysis Framework Documentation
3. Technology Selection Criteria Document
4. Initial Component Interaction Diagram
5. Architecture Decision Records Template and Samples

## Assessment Criteria
- Completeness and usability of decision frameworks
- Clarity of decision-making processes
- Quality of evaluation criteria
- Appropriateness of component interactions
- Effectiveness of ADR templates

## Resources
- Architecture decision record examples
- Decision matrix templates
- Trade-off analysis methodologies
- Component diagram notation guide

# Project 00-A: System Requirements Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, you will analyze the requirements for a scalable web application and map them to technical requirements. This foundational exercise sets the stage for all future architectural decisions in the system design tutorial.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to translate business requirements into technical requirements
- Learn to identify functional and non-functional requirements
- Practice prioritizing architectural quality attributes
- Define system boundaries and constraints

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Module 00 core concepts
- Basic understanding of web application architecture
- Familiarity with system design terminology

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Business Requirements Gathering
1. Review the provided system case study (social media platform, content management system, or ticket booking system - choose one)
2. Identify key stakeholders and their needs
3. Document the core business processes
4. Prioritize business requirements

### Task 2: Functional Requirements Documentation
1. Define user-facing functionality requirements
2. Identify system-to-system integration requirements
3. Document administrative and operational requirements
4. Create a functional requirements matrix

### Task 3: Non-Functional Requirements Analysis
1. Identify performance requirements (response time, throughput)
2. Define scalability requirements (user growth, data volume)
3. Document reliability and availability targets
4. Specify security and compliance requirements
5. Identify maintainability and operational requirements

### Task 4: Architectural Quality Attributes Prioritization
1. Rank quality attributes for the chosen system:
   - Scalability
   - Reliability
   - Performance
   - Security
   - Maintainability
   - Cost-efficiency
2. Justify your prioritization decisions
3. Create a quality attributes trade-off analysis

### Task 5: System Boundaries and Constraints
1. Define the scope of the system
2. Identify integration points with external systems
3. Document technical constraints (technology, infrastructure)
4. Identify budget and resource constraints
5. Document timeline and project constraints

## Deliverables
1. System Requirements Document
2. Functional Requirements Matrix
3. Non-Functional Requirements Specification
4. Quality Attributes Prioritization with Justification
5. System Context Diagram showing boundaries

## Assessment Criteria
- Completeness of requirements analysis
- Clarity of requirement specifications
- Quality of trade-off analysis
- Practicality of identified constraints
- Alignment between business and technical requirements

## Resources
- Requirements analysis templates
- Quality attributes reference guide
- Sample case studies for different system types
- System context diagram examples

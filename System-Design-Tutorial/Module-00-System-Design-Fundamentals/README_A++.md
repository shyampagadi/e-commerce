## Quantitative Decision Framework Integration

### Strategic ROI Calculation Model
```
Architecture Decision ROI = (Business Value - Total Cost) / Total Investment × 100

Business Value Components:
- Revenue Enhancement = New Revenue + Revenue Protection + Market Share Gain
- Cost Optimization = Operational Savings + Efficiency Gains + Risk Mitigation
- Strategic Value = Competitive Advantage + Innovation Enablement + Future Optionality

Total Cost Components:
- Implementation Cost = Technology + Personnel + Training + Opportunity Cost
- Operational Cost = 3-year operational expenses + maintenance + support
- Risk Cost = Σ(Probability × Impact × Mitigation Cost)
```

### Advanced Risk Assessment Matrix
| Risk Category | Probability Model | Impact Calculation | Mitigation Strategy | Cost-Benefit Analysis |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Technical Risk** | Monte Carlo simulation | Performance × Revenue | Redundancy + Testing | ROI = Risk Reduction / Mitigation Cost |
| **Business Risk** | Market analysis + trends | Market Share × Revenue | Diversification + Agility | NPV of risk mitigation |
| **Organizational Risk** | Change readiness score | Productivity × Cost | Training + Communication | Change success probability |
| **Regulatory Risk** | Compliance assessment | Fine + Reputation cost | Compliance + Legal | Regulatory ROI model |

### Performance Economics Framework
```
Performance Value = Σ(Performance Improvement × Business Impact × Time Period)

Performance Metrics:
- Latency Impact: Δ Latency × Conversion Rate × Revenue per Transaction
- Availability Value: Δ Uptime × Hourly Revenue × Customer Retention
- Scalability ROI: Capacity Increase × Growth Rate × Revenue per User
- Security Value: Risk Reduction × Potential Loss × Probability
```

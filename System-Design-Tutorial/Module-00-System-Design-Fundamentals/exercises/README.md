## Exercise 1: The Streaming Wars Crisis (Crisis Response Simulation)

### Background: StreamTech's Black Friday Disaster
**Company**: StreamTech - Mid-size streaming platform (5M subscribers)
**Crisis**: Black Friday 2023 - Complete platform failure during peak traffic
**Your Role**: Newly appointed Chief Architect brought in to prevent future disasters

### The Crisis Timeline
**11:47 PM EST, Nov 23**: Traffic begins climbing toward Black Friday levels
**12:15 AM EST, Nov 24**: Database connection pool exhaustion causes first service degradations
**12:23 AM EST**: Cascading failures as services timeout waiting for database responses
**12:31 AM EST**: Complete platform outage - all users unable to stream content
**12:45 AM EST**: Emergency response team activated, you're called in as incident commander
**1:15 AM EST**: Initial recovery attempts fail, customer complaints flooding social media
**2:30 AM EST**: Partial service restored with severe capacity limitations
**6:00 AM EST**: Full service restored, but reputation damage and subscriber churn beginning

### Stakeholder Pressure Points
**CEO (Sarah Chen)**: "We lost 50,000 subscribers overnight. The board is asking if we need new technical leadership. I need a plan that ensures this never happens again, but we can't spend unlimited money."

**CTO (Marcus Rodriguez)**: "The engineering team is demoralized. They've been asking for infrastructure investment for months. We need solutions that don't require hiring 50 new engineers we can't afford."

**Head of Product (Jennifer Kim)**: "We have three major content launches planned for Q1. Any architectural changes can't disrupt our product roadmap or delay these launches."

**CFO (David Thompson)**: "The outage cost us $2.3M in refunds and lost revenue. Whatever solution you propose needs clear ROI and can't exceed our $5M infrastructure budget for next year."

**Head of Customer Success (Maria Santos)**: "Customer trust is at an all-time low. We need visible improvements that customers can feel, not just internal technical fixes."

### Realistic Constraints
- **Budget**: $5M total infrastructure budget for next 12 months
- **Timeline**: Board presentation in 2 weeks, implementation must start within 30 days
- **Team**: Current team of 25 engineers, hiring freeze in effect for 6 months
- **Technology**: Existing tech stack includes legacy components that can't be replaced quickly
- **Business**: Three major content launches in Q1 that generate 40% of annual revenue
- **Regulatory**: Content licensing agreements require 99.5% uptime or face penalties

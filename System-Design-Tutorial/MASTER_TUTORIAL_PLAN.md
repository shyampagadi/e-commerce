## üéØ Decision Framework Usage Guide

### How to Use These Matrices

1. **Identify Your Requirements**: List your specific technical and business requirements
2. **Weight the Criteria**: Assign importance weights to different factors (1-10 scale)
3. **Score Each Option**: Rate each technology option against your criteria
4. **Calculate Weighted Scores**: Multiply scores by weights and sum totals
5. **Consider Qualitative Factors**: Factor in team expertise, strategic direction, vendor relationships
6. **Document Your Decision**: Record rationale for future reference and team alignment

### Example Decision Process

**Scenario**: Choosing a database for a new e-commerce application

**Requirements Analysis**:
- High transaction volume (10,000+ orders/day)
- Global user base requiring low latency
- Complex product catalog with relationships
- Strong consistency for financial data
- Team has SQL expertise

**Weighted Scoring**:
- ACID transactions (Weight: 10): RDS=10, DynamoDB=3, Aurora=10
- Global distribution (Weight: 8): RDS=2, DynamoDB=10, Aurora=8
- Complex queries (Weight: 7): RDS=10, DynamoDB=2, Aurora=10
- Team expertise (Weight: 6): RDS=9, DynamoDB=4, Aurora=9

**Decision**: Aurora wins with highest weighted score, providing ACID compliance, global capabilities, and SQL compatibility.

   - Prioritization of scenarios

5. **Analyze Architectural Approaches**
   - Sensitivity points (where a small change affects quality)
   - Trade-off points (affecting multiple qualities)
   - Risks and non-risks
   - Risk themes

6. **Document Results**
   - Architectural decisions
   - Rationale and implications

   - CP System (sacrificing availability)
   - AP System (sacrificing consistency)

2. **Consistency Requirements Analysis**
   - Strong consistency requirements
   - Eventual consistency acceptability
   - Causal consistency needs
   - Read-your-writes consistency needs

3. **Availability Requirements Analysis**
   - Maximum acceptable downtime
   - Business impact of unavailability
   - Regional availability needs
   - Degraded operation acceptability

4. **Partition Tolerance Analysis**
   - Network reliability assessment
   - Geographic distribution requirements
   - Communication patterns
   - Failure modes to address

5. **Decision Matrix**
   | Business Requirement | Recommended Approach | Technologies to Consider |
   |----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
   | Financial transactions | CP (consistency over availability) | Traditional RDBMS, Consensus-based systems |
   | Content delivery | AP (availability over consistency) | NoSQL databases, Eventually consistent systems |
   | User activity tracking | AP with conflict resolution | CRDTs, Vector clocks |
   | Inventory management | CP with reconciliation | ACID databases with compensating transactions |

- PostgreSQL database (2TB, performance issues)
- Limited real-time processing experience
- AWS cloud migration in progress

#### Business Constraints
- Cannot disrupt existing batch analytics
- Must show ROI within 12 months
- Compliance with GDPR and CCPA required
- Limited budget for external consultants

### Step 3: Architecture Options Evaluation (45 minutes)

#### Option 1: Lambda Architecture
**Approach**: Separate batch and speed layers with serving layer

**Pros**:

- Fault tolerant with immutable data
- Proven at scale (Netflix, LinkedIn)
- Can reuse existing batch infrastructure

**Cons**:
- Complex to maintain (two codebases)
- Data synchronization challenges
- Higher operational overhead
- Longer development time

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Set up Kafka for data ingestion
2. Implement Storm/Flink for speed layer
3. Enhance existing Spark batch layer
4. Build serving layer with Cassandra
5. Create unified query interface

**Estimated Cost**: $180K/month
**Timeline**: 8 months
**Risk Level**: Medium

#### Option 2: Kappa Architecture
**Approach**: Stream-only processing with reprocessing capability

**Pros**:

2. Implement Delta Lake for data versioning
3. Build streaming applications with same APIs
4. Set up Kafka for data ingestion
5. Create unified monitoring and operations

**Estimated Cost**: $100K/month
**Timeline**: 4 months
**Risk Level**: Low

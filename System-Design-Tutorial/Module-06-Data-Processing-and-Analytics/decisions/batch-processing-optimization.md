# ADR-004: Batch Processing Optimization Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Need to optimize batch processing workloads for cost efficiency, performance, and reliability while handling petabyte-scale data processing requirements.

## Decision
**Primary Platform**: Amazon EMR with Apache Spark
**Optimization Strategy**: Multi-layered approach focusing on resource optimization, data locality, and cost management

## Optimization Framework

### 1. Resource Optimization
```yaml
Cluster Configuration:
  Master: m5.xlarge (1 node)
  Core: r5.2xlarge (3-20 nodes, auto-scaling)
  Task: Spot instances (up to 80% cost savings)
  
Auto-scaling Rules:
  Scale-out: CPU > 75% for 5 minutes
  Scale-in: CPU < 25% for 10 minutes
  Max nodes: 50 (cost protection)
  Min nodes: 3 (availability)
```

### 2. Spark Configuration Optimization
```yaml
Driver Configuration:
  spark.driver.memory: 8g
  spark.driver.cores: 4
  spark.driver.maxResultSize: 2g

Executor Configuration:
  spark.executor.memory: 14g
  spark.executor.cores: 4
  spark.executor.instances: dynamic
  spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled: true

Memory Management:
  spark.sql.adaptive.enabled: true
  spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.enabled: true
  spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enabled: true
```

### 3. Data Processing Patterns
```yaml
File Format Optimization:
  Input: Parquet with Snappy compression
  Output: Delta Lake format for ACID transactions
  Partitioning: Date-based (year/month/day)
  
Processing Strategy:
  Batch Size: 1-4 hours of data per job
  Parallelism: 200-400 partitions per core
  Caching: Intermediate results for iterative algorithms
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Performance Metrics
```yaml
Data Processing Rates:
  Raw Data Ingestion: 10GB/minute
  ETL Transformations: 5GB/minute
  Complex Analytics: 2GB/minute
  
Latency Requirements:
  Simple ETL: < 30 minutes
  Complex Analytics: < 2 hours
  ML Model Training: < 4 hours
  
Cost Targets:
  Processing Cost: < $0.10 per GB processed
  Storage Cost: < $0.02 per GB per month
  Total TCO: < $0.15 per GB lifecycle cost
```

### Optimization Techniques

#### 1. Data Skew Handling
```scala
// Salting technique for skewed joins
val saltedDF = skewedDF.withColumn("salt", 
  (rand() * 100).cast("int"))
  
// Broadcast joins for small tables
val result = largeDF.join(
  broadcast(smallDF), "key")
```

#### 2. Partition Optimization
```scala
// Optimal partition sizing (128MB-1GB per partition)
val optimizedDF = df.repartition(
  col("year"), col("month"), col("day"))
  
// Coalesce for output optimization
optimizedDF.coalesce(numPartitions)
  .write.partitionBy("date")
  .parquet(outputPath)
```

#### 3. Memory Management
```yaml
Garbage Collection Tuning:
  -XX:+UseG1GC
  -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200
  -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=16m
  
Off-heap Storage:
  spark.sql.columnVector.offheap.enabled: true
  spark.memory.offHeap.enabled: true
  spark.memory.offHeap.size: 4g
```

## Cost Optimization Strategy

### 1. Spot Instance Strategy
```yaml
Spot Configuration:
  Task Nodes: 100% spot instances
  Core Nodes: 50% spot instances
  Timeout Action: Switch to on-demand
  
Spot Fleet Configuration:
  Instance Types: r5.xlarge, r5.2xlarge, r5.4xlarge
  Allocation Strategy: diversified
  Target Capacity: 80% of total capacity
```

### 2. Storage Optimization
```yaml
S3 Storage Classes:
  Active Data: S3 Standard (0-30 days)
  Archive Data: S3 IA (30-90 days)
  Cold Data: S3 Glacier (90+ days)
  
Compression Strategy:
  Text Data: GZIP (70% compression)
  Structured Data: Snappy (40% compression, faster)
  Archive Data: BZIP2 (80% compression)
```

### 3. Scheduling Optimization
```yaml
Job Scheduling:
  Peak Hours: Minimal processing (9 AM - 6 PM)
  Off-Peak: Heavy batch processing (10 PM - 6 AM)
  Weekend: Large-scale reprocessing jobs
  
Resource Allocation:
  Critical Jobs: Dedicated clusters
  Regular Jobs: Shared clusters with auto-scaling
  Development: Smaller, cost-optimized clusters
```

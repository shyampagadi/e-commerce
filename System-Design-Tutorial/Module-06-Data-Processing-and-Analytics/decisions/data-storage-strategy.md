# ADR-002: Data Storage Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to establish a comprehensive data storage strategy that supports both operational and analytical workloads while optimizing for cost, performance, and scalability.

## Decision
Implement a multi-tier data storage architecture:

### Hot Tier (Real-time Access)
- **Technology**: DynamoDB + ElastiCache
- **Use Case**: Operational data, user sessions, real-time metrics
- **Retention**: 30 days
- **Cost**: High per GB, optimized for performance

### Warm Tier (Frequent Analytics)
- **Technology**: S3 Standard + Redshift
- **Use Case**: Recent data for analytics, dashboards, reporting
- **Retention**: 1 year
- **Cost**: Medium per GB, balanced performance

### Cold Tier (Archival)
- **Technology**: S3 Glacier + Athena
- **Use Case**: Historical data, compliance, long-term analytics
- **Retention**: 7+ years
- **Cost**: Low per GB, query-based pricing

## Rationale

### Performance Requirements
```
Hot Tier:    < 10ms latency, 100K+ ops/sec
Warm Tier:   < 1s query response, complex analytics
Cold Tier:   < 30s query start, cost-optimized
```

### Cost Analysis
```
Hot:   $25/TB/month (DynamoDB + Cache)
Warm:  $5/TB/month (S3 + Redshift)
Cold:  $1/TB/month (Glacier + Athena queries)
```

### Data Lifecycle
```
Operational → Hot (0-30 days)
Analytics → Warm (30 days - 1 year)  
Archive → Cold (1+ years)
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- Optimized cost per access pattern
- Scalable architecture supporting PB-scale data
- Clear data lifecycle management
- Technology-appropriate workload distribution

### Negative
- Increased complexity in data movement
- Multiple technology stacks to maintain
- Cross-tier query complexity
- Data consistency challenges during transitions

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Hot Tier Setup
```yaml
DynamoDB:
  - On-demand billing for variable workloads
  - Global secondary indexes for query patterns
  - DynamoDB Streams for change capture

ElastiCache:
  - Redis cluster mode for high availability
  - 6-node cluster with automatic failover
  - Memory optimization for session data
```

### Phase 2: Warm Tier Integration
```yaml
S3 Configuration:
  - Intelligent tiering enabled
  - Cross-region replication for DR
  - Lifecycle policies for automatic transition

Redshift Setup:
  - ra3.xlplus nodes for compute scaling
  - Automatic WLM for query optimization
  - Materialized views for common queries
```

### Phase 3: Cold Tier Activation
```yaml
Glacier Configuration:
  - Instant retrieval for recent archives
  - Flexible retrieval for older data
  - Deep archive for compliance data

Athena Optimization:
  - Columnar format conversion (Parquet)
  - Partition pruning strategies
  - Query result caching
```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- Storage costs per tier
- Query performance by tier
- Data movement efficiency
- Access pattern analysis

### Alerts
- Unexpected cost increases
- Performance degradation
- Failed data transitions
- Capacity threshold breaches

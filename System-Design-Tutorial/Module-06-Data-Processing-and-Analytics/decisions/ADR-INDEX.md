## Decision Categories

### Processing Architecture
- Lambda vs Kappa architecture selection
- Real-time vs batch processing trade-offs
- Hybrid processing strategies

### Data Storage
- Data lake vs data warehouse decisions
- Storage format optimization (Parquet, ORC, Avro)
- Partitioning and indexing strategies

### Technology Selection
- Stream processing frameworks (Kinesis, Kafka, Pulsar)
- Batch processing engines (Spark, MapReduce, Flink)
- Analytics engines (Redshift, Athena, EMR)

### Performance Optimization
- Resource allocation strategies
- Cost optimization approaches
- Scalability patterns

## Template Usage

Use the [ADR template](./templates/ADR-TEMPLATE.md) for creating new decision records.

## Review Process

1. Create ADR using template
2. Technical review by data engineering team
3. Architecture review by senior architects
4. Implementation and monitoring

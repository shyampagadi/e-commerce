# Data Processing Architecture Selection Framework

## Decision Context
Selecting the right data processing architecture is crucial for building scalable, maintainable, and cost-effective analytics systems. This framework provides structured guidance for choosing between Lambda, Kappa, and Unified processing architectures.

## Architecture Overview

### Lambda Architecture
**Definition**: Hybrid architecture with separate batch and speed layers, unified by a serving layer.

**Components**:
- **Batch Layer**: Processes all historical data to create accurate batch views
- **Speed Layer**: Processes real-time data for immediate insights  
- **Serving Layer**: Merges batch and real-time views for unified queries

**When to Choose**:
- Need both real-time and batch processing capabilities
- Accuracy is critical (financial, healthcare, compliance)
- Have separate teams for batch and real-time processing
- Can tolerate higher operational complexity for better accuracy

### Kappa Architecture  
**Definition**: Stream-only architecture where all data processing happens in real-time streams.

**Components**:
- **Stream Processing Layer**: Single processing engine for all data
- **Serving Layer**: Stores processed results for queries
- **Reprocessing**: Replay historical data through stream processor

**When to Choose**:
- Real-time processing is the primary requirement
- Want to minimize architectural complexity
- Have strong streaming expertise in the team
- Can handle reprocessing for historical corrections

### Unified Processing
**Definition**: Single framework that handles both batch and streaming workloads with consistent APIs.

**Components**:
- **Unified Engine**: Single processing framework (Spark, Flink, Beam)
- **Storage Layer**: Consistent storage for both batch and streaming data
- **API Layer**: Common APIs for both processing modes

**When to Choose**:
- Want consistency between batch and streaming logic
- Have limited team resources for multiple technologies
- Need rapid development and deployment
- Can accept framework-specific limitations

## Conclusion

The choice of data processing architecture significantly impacts system performance, operational complexity, and business outcomes. Use this framework to:

1. **Assess Requirements**: Clearly define latency, accuracy, and complexity requirements
2. **Evaluate Options**: Use the decision matrix to score different architectures
3. **Consider Context**: Factor in team skills, organizational constraints, and business goals
4. **Plan Implementation**: Follow phased implementation approaches with clear success metrics
5. **Monitor and Evolve**: Continuously assess and evolve the architecture as requirements change

Remember that architecture decisions are not permanent. Plan for evolution and be prepared to migrate as requirements, technologies, and organizational capabilities change.

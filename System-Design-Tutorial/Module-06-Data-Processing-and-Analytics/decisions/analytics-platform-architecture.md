```

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Raw Data → S3 (Data Lake) → Glue ETL → Curated Data
    ↓                                        ↓
Kinesis → Real-time Processing → ElastiCache → Dashboards
    ↓                                        ↓
Stream → Kinesis Analytics → Redshift → QuickSight
                                ↓
                           Athena ← S3 (Historical)
```

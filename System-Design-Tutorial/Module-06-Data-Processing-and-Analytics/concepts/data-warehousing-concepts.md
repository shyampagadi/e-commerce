# Data Warehousing Concepts

## Overview
A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores integrated data from multiple sources, optimized for analytical processing and business intelligence. It serves as the foundation for reporting, analytics, and decision-making in organizations.

  UPDATE Dim_Customer 
  SET city = 'New York', 
      state = 'NY',
      last_updated = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  WHERE customer_key = 12345;

Advantages:

  ) VALUES (
    'CUST001', 'John Smith', 'New York', 'NY',
    '2023-01-15', '9999-12-31', 'Y'
  );
  
  -- Update previous record
  UPDATE Dim_Customer 
  SET expiration_date = '2023-01-14',

Hierarchies:
  Time Hierarchy:
    Year → Quarter → Month → Week → Day → Hour
  
  Geography Hierarchy:
    Country → Region → State → City → Store
  
  Product Hierarchy:
    Category → Subcategory → Brand → Product

Cube Structure:
  - Multi-dimensional array of data
  - Intersection of dimensions contains measures
  - Pre-aggregated for performance
  - Sparse cube optimization
```

### OLAP Operations
```yaml
Drill-Down:
  Purpose: Navigate from summary to detail
  Example: Year → Quarter → Month → Day
  Implementation:
    SELECT product_category, month, SUM(sales_amount)
    FROM sales_fact f
    JOIN date_dim d ON f.date_key = d.date_key
    WHERE d.year = 2023
    GROUP BY product_category, month;

Drill-Up (Roll-Up):
  Purpose: Navigate from detail to summary
  Example: Day → Month → Quarter → Year
  Implementation:
    SELECT product_category, year, SUM(sales_amount)
    FROM sales_fact f
    JOIN date_dim d ON f.date_key = d.date_key
    GROUP BY product_category, year;

Slice:
  Purpose: Select specific dimension value
  Example: Sales data for Q1 2023 only
  Implementation:
    SELECT product_name, customer_segment, SUM(sales_amount)
    FROM sales_fact f
    JOIN date_dim d ON f.date_key = d.date_key
    WHERE d.quarter = 'Q1' AND d.year = 2023
    GROUP BY product_name, customer_segment;

Dice:
  Purpose: Select multiple dimension values
  Example: Sales for specific products, regions, and time period
  Implementation:
    SELECT product_name, region, month, SUM(sales_amount)
    FROM sales_fact f
    JOIN date_dim d ON f.date_key = d.date_key
    JOIN product_dim p ON f.product_key = p.product_key
    JOIN geography_dim g ON f.geography_key = g.geography_key
    WHERE p.category IN ('Electronics', 'Clothing')
      AND g.region IN ('North', 'South')
      AND d.year = 2023
    GROUP BY product_name, region, month;

Pivot:
  Purpose: Rotate cube to view different perspectives
  Example: Transpose rows and columns
  Implementation:
    SELECT *
    FROM (
      SELECT region, quarter, sales_amount
      FROM sales_summary
    ) PIVOT (
      SUM(sales_amount)
      FOR quarter IN ('Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4')
    );
```

## Aggregate Tables and Materialized Views

### Aggregate Design Strategies
```yaml
Aggregation Levels:
  Daily Aggregates:
    - Sum of daily transactions
    - Daily customer counts
    - Daily product sales
    - Daily store performance
  
  Monthly Aggregates:
    - Monthly sales summaries
    - Customer behavior patterns
    - Product performance trends
    - Regional comparisons
  
  Yearly Aggregates:
    - Annual business metrics
    - Year-over-year comparisons
    - Long-term trend analysis
    - Strategic planning data

Aggregation Rules:
  Additive Measures:
    - Can be summed across all dimensions
    - Examples: sales amount, quantity, count
    - Simple aggregation logic
    - Most common type of measure
  
  Semi-Additive Measures:
    - Can be summed across some dimensions
    - Examples: account balance, inventory levels
    - Time-sensitive aggregations
    - Require special handling
  
  Non-Additive Measures:
    - Cannot be summed across dimensions
    - Examples: ratios, percentages, averages
    - Require weighted calculations
    - Complex aggregation logic
```

### Materialized Views
```yaml
Purpose:
  - Pre-compute complex queries
  - Improve query performance
  - Reduce computational overhead
  - Enable real-time analytics

Types:
  Complete Refresh:
    - Rebuild entire view from scratch
    - Simple but resource-intensive
    - Suitable for small to medium views
    - Ensures data consistency
  
  Incremental Refresh:
    - Update only changed data
    - More efficient for large views
    - Requires change tracking
    - Complex implementation
  
  Fast Refresh:
    - Use materialized view logs
    - Near real-time updates
    - Minimal performance impact
    - Database-specific features

Implementation Example:
  -- Create materialized view
  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales_summary AS
  SELECT 
    d.year,
    d.month,
    p.category,
    g.region,
    SUM(f.sales_amount) as total_sales,
    COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
    AVG(f.sales_amount) as avg_transaction
  FROM sales_fact f
  JOIN date_dim d ON f.date_key = d.date_key
  JOIN product_dim p ON f.product_key = p.product_key
  JOIN geography_dim g ON f.geography_key = g.geography_key
  GROUP BY d.year, d.month, p.category, g.region;
  
  -- Refresh strategy
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales_summary;
```

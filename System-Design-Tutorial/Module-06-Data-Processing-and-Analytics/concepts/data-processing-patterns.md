# Data Processing Architecture Patterns

## Overview
Data processing patterns define how systems handle, transform, and analyze data at scale. Understanding these patterns is crucial for designing systems that can process everything from real-time streams to massive batch workloads efficiently and reliably.

## Core Processing Paradigms

### 1. Batch Processing
**Definition**: Processing large volumes of data in discrete chunks or batches, typically during off-peak hours.

**Characteristics**:
- High throughput, high latency
- Processes bounded datasets
- Optimized for resource efficiency
- Fault tolerance through job restart
- Strong consistency guarantees

**Use Cases**:
- ETL pipelines for data warehouses
- Monthly/quarterly financial reports
- Machine learning model training
- Data archival and compliance processing
- Large-scale data migrations

**Implementation Patterns**:
```yaml
MapReduce Pattern:
  Map Phase: Transform and filter data in parallel
  Shuffle Phase: Redistribute data by key
  Reduce Phase: Aggregate and summarize results
  
Advantages:
  - Handles petabyte-scale data
  - Automatic fault tolerance
  - Scales horizontally
  
Disadvantages:
  - High latency (minutes to hours)
  - Complex for iterative algorithms
  - Disk I/O intensive
```

### 2. Stream Processing
**Definition**: Processing continuous streams of data in real-time or near real-time as events arrive.

**Characteristics**:
- Low latency, variable throughput
- Processes unbounded datasets
- Optimized for responsiveness
- Fault tolerance through checkpointing
- Eventually consistent by default

**Use Cases**:
- Real-time fraud detection
- Live dashboards and monitoring
- IoT sensor data processing
- Social media feed generation
- Financial trading systems

**Implementation Patterns**:
```yaml
Event-Driven Processing:
  Event Ingestion: Capture events as they occur
  Stream Processing: Transform events in flight
  State Management: Maintain processing state
  Output Generation: Emit results to downstream systems
  
Advantages:
  - Sub-second latency
  - Continuous processing
  - Real-time insights
  
Disadvantages:
  - Complex state management
  - Harder to debug
  - Resource intensive
```

### 3. Micro-Batch Processing
**Definition**: Hybrid approach that processes small batches of data at frequent intervals, combining benefits of both paradigms.

**Characteristics**:
- Medium latency (seconds to minutes)
- Processes small bounded datasets frequently
- Balances throughput and latency
- Simplified fault tolerance
- Tunable consistency models

**Use Cases**:
- Near real-time analytics
- Incremental data processing
- Lambda architecture speed layer

- Social media analytics

## Architectural Patterns

### 1. Lambda Architecture
**Components**:
- **Batch Layer**: Processes all historical data to create batch views
- **Speed Layer**: Processes real-time data for immediate insights
- **Serving Layer**: Merges batch and real-time views for queries

```yaml
Lambda Architecture Flow:
  Data Ingestion → Batch Layer (Hadoop/Spark) → Batch Views
                → Speed Layer (Storm/Flink) → Real-time Views
                → Serving Layer (HBase/Cassandra) → Query Interface

Advantages:
  - Handles both batch and real-time processing
  - Fault tolerant and scalable
  - Provides both accuracy and speed
  
Disadvantages:
  - Complex to maintain (two codebases)
  - Data synchronization challenges
  - Higher operational overhead
```

### 2. Kappa Architecture
**Components**:
- **Stream Processing Layer**: Single processing engine for all data
- **Serving Layer**: Stores processed results for queries
- **Reprocessing**: Replay historical data through stream processor

```yaml
Kappa Architecture Flow:
  Data Ingestion → Stream Processing (Kafka + Flink) → Serving Layer
                → Reprocessing (Historical Replay) ↗

Advantages:
  - Single codebase and processing engine
  - Simpler architecture and operations
  - Consistent processing logic
  
Disadvantages:
  - Stream processor must handle all use cases
  - Reprocessing can be resource intensive
  - May not suit all batch processing needs
```

### 3. Unified Batch and Stream Processing
**Modern Approach**: Single engine that can handle both batch and streaming workloads with the same API and processing model.

```yaml
Unified Processing Examples:
  Apache Spark:
    - Spark SQL for batch processing
    - Structured Streaming for stream processing
    - Same DataFrame API for both
  
  Apache Flink:
    - DataSet API for batch processing
    - DataStream API for stream processing
    - Table API unifies both approaches
  
  Apache Beam:
    - Single programming model
    - Portable across execution engines
    - Handles both bounded and unbounded data
```

## Data Flow Patterns

### 1. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
**Process Flow**:
1. **Extract**: Pull data from source systems
2. **Transform**: Clean, validate, and transform data
3. **Load**: Insert processed data into target system

**Characteristics**:
- Transformation happens before loading
- Requires staging area for processing
- Schema-on-write approach
- Better data quality control

**Use Cases**:
- Data warehouse loading
- System integration
- Data migration projects
- Compliance reporting

### 2. ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)
**Process Flow**:
1. **Extract**: Pull data from source systems
2. **Load**: Load raw data into target system
3. **Transform**: Transform data within target system

**Characteristics**:
- Leverages target system's processing power
- Schema-on-read approach
- Faster initial data loading
- More flexible for ad-hoc analysis

**Use Cases**:
- Data lake ingestion
- Cloud data warehouses
- Big data analytics
- Self-service analytics

### 3. Change Data Capture (CDC)
**Process**: Capture and propagate data changes from source systems in real-time.

**Implementation Approaches**:
```yaml
Log-Based CDC:
  - Monitor database transaction logs
  - Capture all data changes
  - Minimal impact on source system
  - Examples: Debezium, AWS DMS
  
Trigger-Based CDC:
  - Database triggers capture changes
  - Custom logic for change detection
  - Higher impact on source system
  - More control over change format
  
Timestamp-Based CDC:
  - Query for records modified since last check
  - Requires timestamp columns
  - Simple but may miss deletes
  - Good for batch CDC processes
```

## Processing Topology Patterns

### 1. Linear Pipeline
**Structure**: Sequential processing stages where output of one stage feeds into the next.

```yaml
Linear Pipeline Example:
  Raw Data → Validation → Transformation → Enrichment → Output
  
Advantages:
  - Simple to understand and debug
  - Easy to monitor and maintain
  - Clear data lineage
  
Disadvantages:
  - Single point of failure
  - Limited parallelism
  - Bottlenecks affect entire pipeline
```

### 2. Fan-Out/Fan-In
**Structure**: Split processing into parallel branches and merge results.

```yaml
Fan-Out/Fan-In Example:
  Input → Split → [Branch 1, Branch 2, Branch 3] → Merge → Output
  
Use Cases:
  - Parallel processing of different data types
  - A/B testing of processing logic
  - Redundant processing for reliability
  
Considerations:
  - Synchronization challenges
  - Partial failure handling
  - Result ordering and merging
```

### 3. Complex Event Processing (CEP)
**Structure**: Pattern matching and correlation across multiple event streams.

```yaml
CEP Patterns:
  Sequence Detection: A followed by B within time window
  Absence Detection: A not followed by B within time window
  Aggregation: Count, sum, average over time windows
  Correlation: Events from different streams related by key
  
Applications:
  - Fraud detection (unusual transaction patterns)
  - System monitoring (error sequence detection)
  - IoT analytics (sensor correlation patterns)
  - Trading systems (market pattern recognition)
```

## State Management Patterns

### 1. Stateless Processing
**Characteristics**:
- Each event processed independently
- No memory of previous events
- Easily scalable and fault tolerant
- Limited processing capabilities

**Use Cases**:
- Simple transformations and filtering
- Stateless enrichment from external sources
- Format conversions
- Data validation

### 2. Stateful Processing
**Characteristics**:
- Maintains state across events
- Enables complex analytics and aggregations
- Requires state management and recovery
- More complex fault tolerance

**State Types**:
```yaml
Keyed State:
  - State partitioned by key
  - Enables parallel processing
  - Examples: user sessions, account balances
  
Operator State:
  - State shared across all parallel instances
  - Used for global coordination
  - Examples: broadcast state, union state
  
Windowed State:
  - State maintained for time or count windows
  - Automatically cleaned up after window expires
  - Examples: sliding averages, session windows
```

### 3. State Backends
**Options for storing and managing processing state**:

```yaml
Memory State Backend:
  - Fastest access
  - Limited by available memory
  - Lost on failure (use for testing only)
  
File System State Backend:
  - Persistent storage
  - Good for development and small state
  - Limited scalability
  
RocksDB State Backend:
  - Embedded key-value store
  - Handles large state efficiently
  - Incremental checkpointing
  - Production recommended
```

## Windowing Strategies

### 1. Time Windows
**Tumbling Windows**: Fixed-size, non-overlapping time intervals
```yaml
Example: 5-minute tumbling windows
[00:00-00:05) [00:05-00:10) [00:10-00:15) ...

Use Cases:
- Periodic aggregations (hourly sales)
- Regular reporting intervals
- Rate limiting (requests per minute)
```

**Sliding Windows**: Fixed-size, overlapping time intervals
```yaml
Example: 5-minute windows sliding every 1 minute
[00:00-00:05) [00:01-00:06) [00:02-00:07) ...

Use Cases:
- Moving averages
- Trend analysis
- Anomaly detection
```

**Session Windows**: Variable-size windows based on activity gaps
```yaml
Example: Web session analysis
User A: [Login...Activity...Activity] [Gap] [Activity...Logout]
        ←---- Session Window 1 ----→        ←- Session Window 2 -→

Use Cases:
- User session analysis
- Device activity tracking
- Conversation analysis
```

### 2. Count Windows
**Fixed Count**: Windows containing exact number of events
**Sliding Count**: Overlapping windows with fixed event count

### 3. Custom Windows
**Business Logic Windows**: Windows defined by business rules
- Trading day windows (market open to close)
- Billing cycle windows
- Campaign duration windows

## Fault Tolerance Patterns

### 1. Checkpointing
**Process**: Periodically save processing state to enable recovery from failures.

```yaml
Checkpoint Strategy:
  Frequency: Balance between recovery time and overhead
  Storage: Distributed file system or object storage
  Consistency: Ensure all operators checkpoint together
  Recovery: Restore from last successful checkpoint
  
Implementation:
  - Synchronous: Stop processing during checkpoint
  - Asynchronous: Continue processing while checkpointing
  - Incremental: Only save changed state
```

### 2. Exactly-Once Processing
**Guarantee**: Each event is processed exactly once, even in case of failures.

**Implementation Approaches**:
```yaml
Idempotent Operations:
  - Design operations to be safely retried
  - Use unique keys for deduplication
  - Atomic operations where possible
  
Transactional Processing:
  - Two-phase commit across systems
  - Distributed transactions
  - Saga pattern for long-running transactions
  
Deduplication:
  - Track processed event IDs
  - Use bloom filters for efficiency
  - Time-based cleanup of tracking data
```

### 3. Backpressure Handling
**Problem**: Downstream systems cannot keep up with upstream data rate.

**Solutions**:
```yaml
Rate Limiting:
  - Throttle upstream producers
  - Use token bucket algorithms
  - Implement circuit breakers
  
Buffering:
  - Queue excess data temporarily
  - Use persistent queues for durability
  - Monitor queue depth and latency
  
Load Shedding:
  - Drop less important data
  - Sample data when overloaded
  - Prioritize critical events
  
Auto-Scaling:
  - Scale processing resources dynamically
  - Use metrics-based scaling policies
  - Implement predictive scaling
```

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### 1. Partitioning Strategies
**Purpose**: Distribute data and processing load across multiple nodes.

```yaml
Key-Based Partitioning:
  - Hash partitioning for even distribution
  - Range partitioning for ordered data
  - Custom partitioning for business logic
  
Time-Based Partitioning:
  - Partition by event time or processing time
  - Enables parallel processing of time ranges
  - Simplifies data lifecycle management
  
Hybrid Partitioning:
  - Combine multiple partitioning strategies
  - Example: Partition by user_id and date
  - Balance load distribution and query efficiency
```

### 2. Caching Patterns
**Levels of Caching**:
```yaml
Input Caching:
  - Cache frequently accessed reference data
  - Reduce external system calls
  - Use local or distributed caches
  
Processing Caching:
  - Cache intermediate computation results
  - Avoid recomputing expensive operations
  - Use memoization techniques
  
Output Caching:
  - Cache final results for repeated queries
  - Implement cache invalidation strategies
  - Use TTL-based or event-driven expiration
```

### 3. Resource Optimization
**CPU Optimization**:
- Vectorized operations
- Parallel processing within nodes
- Efficient serialization formats

**Memory Optimization**:
- Object pooling and reuse
- Off-heap storage for large datasets
- Garbage collection tuning

**I/O Optimization**:
- Batch reads and writes
- Compression for network and storage
- Asynchronous I/O operations

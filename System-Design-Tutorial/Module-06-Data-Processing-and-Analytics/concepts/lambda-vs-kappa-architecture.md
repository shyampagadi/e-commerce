# Lambda vs Kappa Architecture: Comprehensive Comparison

## Architecture Overview

### Lambda Architecture
**Definition**: A data processing architecture that handles massive quantities of data by taking advantage of both batch and stream processing methods.

**Core Principle**: Combine the benefits of batch processing (accuracy, completeness) with stream processing (low latency) through separate processing layers.

**Components**:
```yaml
Batch Layer:
  Purpose: Process all historical data to create accurate batch views
  Characteristics: High throughput, high latency, strong consistency
  Technology: Hadoop, Spark, EMR
  Data: Immutable, append-only master dataset

Speed Layer:
  Purpose: Process real-time data for immediate insights
  Characteristics: Low latency, eventual consistency
  Technology: Storm, Flink, Kafka Streams
  Data: Incremental updates, temporary views

Serving Layer:
  Purpose: Merge batch and speed layer results for unified queries
  Characteristics: Random read access, low latency queries
  Technology: Cassandra, HBase, DynamoDB
  Data: Pre-computed views from both layers
```

### Kappa Architecture
**Definition**: A simplified architecture where all data processing is done in real-time streams, eliminating the need for separate batch processing.

**Core Principle**: Everything is a stream - handle both real-time and historical data through the same stream processing system.

**Components**:
```yaml
Stream Processing Layer:
  Purpose: Process all data (real-time and historical) as streams
  Characteristics: Unified processing model, consistent semantics
  Technology: Kafka, Flink, Kafka Streams
  Data: Event streams with replay capability

Serving Layer:
  Purpose: Store processed results for queries
  Characteristics: Optimized for read access patterns
  Technology: Cassandra, Elasticsearch, DynamoDB
  Data: Materialized views from stream processing

Reprocessing Framework:
  Purpose: Handle historical data corrections and algorithm updates
  Characteristics: Replay capability, versioning support
  Technology: Kafka retention, custom replay systems
  Data: Historical event streams with long retention
```

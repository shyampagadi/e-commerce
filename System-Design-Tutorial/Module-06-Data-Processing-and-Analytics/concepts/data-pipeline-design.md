# Data Pipeline Design

## Overview
Data pipelines are automated workflows that move and transform data from source systems to destination systems. They form the backbone of modern data architectures, enabling organizations to process, analyze, and derive insights from their data at scale.

## Pipeline Architecture Patterns

### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
```yaml
Process Flow:
  1. Extract: Pull data from source systems
  2. Transform: Clean, validate, and transform data
  3. Load: Insert processed data into target system

Characteristics:
  - Transformation happens before loading
  - Requires staging area for processing
  - Schema-on-write approach
  - Better data quality control
  - Higher upfront processing cost

Use Cases:
  - Data warehouse loading
  - Regulatory reporting
  - Data migration projects
  - Systems with strict schema requirements

Advantages:
  - Data quality validation before loading
  - Consistent data format in target
  - Better performance for analytical queries
  - Easier to implement business rules

Disadvantages:
  - Longer processing time
  - Requires more storage for staging
  - Less flexible for changing requirements
  - Higher computational overhead
```

### ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)
```yaml
Process Flow:
  1. Extract: Pull data from source systems
  2. Load: Load raw data into target system
  3. Transform: Transform data within target system

Characteristics:
  - Transformation happens after loading
  - Leverages target system's processing power
  - Schema-on-read approach
  - More flexible for ad-hoc analysis
  - Faster initial data loading

Use Cases:
  - Data lake ingestion
  - Cloud data warehouses
  - Big data analytics
  - Self-service analytics platforms

Advantages:
  - Faster data availability
  - Leverages modern compute power
  - More flexible for changing requirements
  - Better for exploratory analysis

Disadvantages:
  - Data quality issues in raw data
  - Requires powerful target system
  - More complex query logic
  - Potential performance issues
```

    - Provides complete change history
    
    Implementation:
      - Database-specific log readers
      - Debezium for Kafka integration
      - AWS DMS for managed CDC
      - Custom log parsing solutions
  
  Trigger-based CDC:

      - Change table creation
      - Custom notification mechanisms
      - Batch change processing
  
  Timestamp-based CDC:
    - Query for records modified since last check
    - Requires timestamp columns
    - Simple but may miss deletes
    - Good for batch CDC processes
    
    Implementation:
      - Modified timestamp tracking
      - Incremental query processing
      - Soft delete handling
      - Watermark management

Benefits:

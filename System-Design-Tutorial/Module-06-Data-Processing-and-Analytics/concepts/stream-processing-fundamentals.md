# Stream Processing Fundamentals

## Overview
Stream processing is a data processing paradigm that handles continuous streams of data in real-time or near real-time. Unlike batch processing, which operates on finite datasets, stream processing deals with unbounded data streams that arrive continuously.

## Core Concepts

### Event Time vs Processing Time
```yaml
Event Time:
  Definition: When an event actually occurred in the real world
  Characteristics:
    - Embedded in the event data (timestamp field)
    - Immutable once set
    - May arrive out of order
    - Critical for accurate analytics
  
  Use Cases:
    - Financial transaction processing
    - IoT sensor data analysis
    - User behavior tracking
    - Fraud detection systems

Processing Time:
  Definition: When an event is processed by the stream processing system
  Characteristics:
    - Assigned by the processing system
    - Always increases monotonically
    - Easier to implement
    - May not reflect real-world timing
  
  Use Cases:
    - System monitoring and alerting
    - Simple aggregations
    - Rate limiting
    - Basic analytics where timing precision isn't critical
```

### Watermarks and Late Data
```yaml
Watermarks:
  Purpose: Mechanism to handle out-of-order events and late arrivals
  Definition: Timestamp indicating that no events with timestamp < watermark will arrive
  
  Types:
    Perfect Watermarks:
      - Guarantee no late data
      - Difficult to achieve in practice
      - Used when data source provides guarantees
    
    Heuristic Watermarks:
      - Allow some late data
      - Based on observed patterns
      - More practical for real-world systems
  
  Configuration:
    Fixed Delay: watermark = max_event_time - fixed_delay
    Percentile-based: watermark = percentile(event_times, 95%)
    Machine Learning: Predict based on historical patterns

Late Data Handling:
  Strategies:
    - Drop late events (simple but lossy)
    - Update results when late data arrives
    - Maintain separate late data processing
    - Use allowed lateness windows
  
  Implementation:
    Allowed Lateness: grace period after watermark
    Side Outputs: Route late data to separate stream
    Triggers: Custom logic for result updates
```

### Stream Processing Guarantees
```yaml
At-Most-Once:
  Guarantee: Each event is processed zero or one times
  Characteristics:
    - No duplicates
    - Possible data loss on failures
    - Lowest overhead
    - Fastest processing
  
  Use Cases:
    - Monitoring and alerting (approximate results acceptable)
    - Non-critical analytics
    - High-throughput scenarios where speed > accuracy

At-Least-Once:
  Guarantee: Each event is processed one or more times
  Characteristics:
    - No data loss
    - Possible duplicates
    - Requires idempotent operations
    - Moderate overhead
  
  Use Cases:
    - Financial transactions (with idempotency)
    - Critical business metrics
    - Audit logging
    - Most production systems

Exactly-Once:
  Guarantee: Each event is processed exactly one time
  Characteristics:
    - No data loss or duplicates
    - Highest overhead
    - Complex implementation
    - Strongest guarantee
  
  Use Cases:
    - Financial systems
    - Billing and payments
    - Critical state updates
    - Regulatory compliance scenarios
  
  Implementation Approaches:
    Transactional Processing: Two-phase commit across systems
    Idempotent Operations: Design operations to be safely retried
    Deduplication: Track processed event IDs
    Checkpointing: Consistent snapshots of processing state
```

## Windowing in Stream Processing

### Window Types
```yaml
Time Windows:
  Tumbling Windows:
    - Fixed size, non-overlapping
    - Each event belongs to exactly one window
    - Simple to implement and understand
    - Good for periodic aggregations
    
    Example: 5-minute tumbling windows
    [00:00-00:05) [00:05-00:10) [00:10-00:15) ...
  
  Sliding Windows:
    - Fixed size, overlapping
    - Events can belong to multiple windows
    - Smooth continuous results
    - Higher computational cost
    
    Example: 5-minute windows, sliding every 1 minute
    [00:00-00:05) [00:01-00:06) [00:02-00:07) ...
  
  Session Windows:
    - Variable size based on activity gaps
    - Grouped by periods of activity
    - Natural for user behavior analysis
    - Complex state management
    
    Example: Web user sessions with 30-minute timeout
    [Login...Activity...Activity] [Gap] [Activity...Logout]

Count Windows:
  Fixed Count: Exactly N events per window
  Sliding Count: Overlapping windows with N events
  
Custom Windows:
  Business Logic: Windows defined by application rules
  Examples: Trading day windows, billing cycles, campaigns
```

### Window Triggers
```yaml
Trigger Types:
  Time-based Triggers:
    - Fire when watermark passes window end
    - Most common for time windows
    - Handles late data with allowed lateness
  
  Count-based Triggers:
    - Fire when window reaches certain size
    - Useful for count windows
    - Can combine with time triggers
  
  Processing Time Triggers:
    - Fire based on wall-clock time
    - Useful for periodic outputs
    - Independent of event time
  
  Custom Triggers:
    - Application-specific logic
    - Combine multiple conditions
    - Complex business rules

Trigger Behavior:
  Fire and Purge: Emit result and discard window state
  Fire and Continue: Emit result but keep window state
  Accumulating: Include all data seen so far
  Discarding: Only include new data since last trigger
```

## State Management

### State Types
```yaml
Keyed State:
  Scope: Per key (user, device, account)
  Partitioning: Automatically partitioned by key
  Scalability: Enables parallel processing
  
  State Types:
    ValueState<T>: Single value per key
    ListState<T>: List of values per key
    MapState<K,V>: Key-value map per key
    ReducingState<T>: Aggregated value per key
    AggregatingState<IN,OUT>: Custom aggregation per key

Operator State:
  Scope: Per parallel operator instance
  Partitioning: Manual redistribution on scaling
  Use Cases: Source offsets, broadcast state
  
  State Types:
    ListState: Redistributable list state
    UnionListState: Union of all parallel states
    BroadcastState: Read-only state broadcast to all

Global State:
  Scope: Across entire application
  Challenges: Consistency, scalability
  Implementation: External systems (databases, caches)
```

### State Backends
```yaml
Memory State Backend:
  Storage: JVM heap memory
  Performance: Fastest access
  Durability: Lost on failure
  Scalability: Limited by memory
  Use Case: Development and testing

File System State Backend:
  Storage: Local or distributed file system
  Performance: Good for small state
  Durability: Persistent across restarts
  Scalability: Limited by single machine
  Use Case: Small production deployments

RocksDB State Backend:
  Storage: Embedded key-value store
  Performance: Good for large state
  Durability: Persistent with incremental checkpoints
  Scalability: Handles TB-scale state
  Use Case: Production deployments with large state
  
  Configuration:
    Block Cache: In-memory cache for frequently accessed data
    Write Buffer: Memory buffer for writes
    Compaction: Background optimization process
    Compression: Reduce storage footprint
```

## Fault Tolerance and Recovery

### Checkpointing
```yaml
Purpose: Create consistent snapshots of processing state
Process:
  1. Coordinator initiates checkpoint
  2. Sources inject checkpoint barriers
  3. Operators align barriers and snapshot state
  4. State is written to persistent storage
  5. Checkpoint completion is acknowledged

Checkpoint Strategies:
  Synchronous: Stop processing during checkpoint
    - Pros: Simple, consistent
    - Cons: Higher latency impact
  
  Asynchronous: Continue processing while checkpointing
    - Pros: Lower latency impact
    - Cons: More complex, requires copy-on-write

Incremental Checkpointing:
  - Only checkpoint changed state
  - Reduces checkpoint size and time
  - Requires state backend support (RocksDB)
  - Significant performance improvement for large state

Configuration:
  Interval: Balance between recovery time and overhead
  Timeout: Maximum time allowed for checkpoint
  Retention: Number of checkpoints to keep
  Storage: Distributed file system or object storage
```

### Recovery Process
```yaml
Failure Detection:
  - Heartbeat monitoring between components
  - Task failure detection and reporting
  - Automatic restart policies
  - Cascading failure prevention

Recovery Steps:
  1. Stop all running tasks
  2. Identify latest successful checkpoint
  3. Reset all operators to checkpoint state
  4. Restart processing from checkpoint
  5. Replay events since checkpoint

Recovery Guarantees:
  - Exactly-once: State and outputs consistent
  - At-least-once: May replay some events
  - At-most-once: May lose some events

Recovery Time:
  Factors: Checkpoint size, network bandwidth, parallelism
  Optimization: Incremental checkpoints, local recovery
  Typical: Seconds to minutes for most applications
```

## Performance Optimization

### Parallelism and Scaling
```yaml
Task Parallelism:
  - Number of parallel instances per operator
  - Determined by data partitioning
  - Limited by available resources
  - Key factor in throughput

Data Partitioning:
  Key-based: Hash partitioning by key
  Random: Round-robin distribution
  Custom: Application-specific logic
  Broadcast: Replicate to all instances

Scaling Strategies:
  Vertical Scaling: Increase resources per instance
  Horizontal Scaling: Increase number of instances
  Auto-scaling: Dynamic adjustment based on load
  Predictive Scaling: Scale based on patterns
```

### Memory Management
```yaml
JVM Tuning:
  Heap Size: Balance between performance and GC
  GC Algorithm: Choose appropriate collector
  Off-heap Storage: Reduce GC pressure
  Memory Pools: Separate pools for different uses

State Size Optimization:
  Data Types: Use efficient serialization
  State TTL: Expire old state automatically
  State Compaction: Periodic cleanup
  Compression: Reduce storage footprint

Network Optimization:
  Serialization: Efficient data formats (Avro, Protobuf)
  Compression: Reduce network traffic
  Batching: Group multiple records
  Connection Pooling: Reuse connections
```

### Monitoring and Debugging
```yaml
Key Metrics:
  Throughput: Records processed per second
  Latency: End-to-end processing time
  Backpressure: Queue depths and processing delays
  Resource Utilization: CPU, memory, network usage
  Error Rates: Failed records and exceptions

Debugging Techniques:
  Logging: Structured logging with correlation IDs
  Metrics: Custom business and technical metrics
  Tracing: Distributed tracing across components
  Profiling: CPU and memory profiling
  Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, chaos engineering

Common Issues:
  Backpressure: Downstream cannot keep up
  Hot Keys: Uneven data distribution
  Memory Leaks: Growing state or object retention
  Serialization: Inefficient data formats
  Network: Bandwidth or connectivity issues
```

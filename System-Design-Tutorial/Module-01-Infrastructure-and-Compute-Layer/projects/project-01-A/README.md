# Project 01-A: The Hypergrowth Infrastructure Crisis

## Project Overview: When Success Becomes the Problem

**Company**: SocialWave - Social media platform experiencing viral adoption
**Challenge**: 50x user growth in 6 months overwhelming infrastructure, threatening business survival
**Your Role**: Head of Infrastructure Engineering leading emergency scaling initiative
**Timeline**: 90 days to stabilize platform or face complete business collapse

## The Hypergrowth Nightmare: Success at Scale

### Business Context: Viral Adoption Crisis
**Growth Trajectory**: 2M to 100M users in 6 months following viral TikTok trend
**Infrastructure Reality**: Systems designed for 5M users now serving 100M with constant failures
**Financial Pressure**: Burning $50M monthly on emergency infrastructure while revenue lags user growth
**Competitive Threat**: Established platforms (Instagram, Snapchat) launching competing features to recapture users

### The Perfect Storm of Constraints

#### Technical Constraints (Infrastructure Reality)
**Current Architecture Limitations**:
- **Database Bottleneck**: Single PostgreSQL instance handling 10x designed capacity
- **Application Servers**: 50 servers designed for 100K concurrent users, now seeing 2M concurrent
- **CDN Overload**: Content delivery network failing under 100x traffic increase
- **Storage Crisis**: User-generated content growing 500GB daily, storage costs exploding

**Legacy Technical Debt**:
- **Monolithic Architecture**: Single application unable to scale components independently
- **Manual Scaling**: No auto-scaling infrastructure, requiring manual intervention for capacity changes
- **Monitoring Gaps**: Limited observability into system performance and user experience
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Rapid growth exposed security gaps requiring immediate attention

#### Financial Constraints (Startup Reality)
**Funding Situation**:
- **Current Runway**: 8 months of funding remaining at current burn rate
- **Infrastructure Costs**: $50M monthly (was $2M before growth), consuming 80% of available capital
- **Revenue Lag**: User monetization averaging $0.50 per user monthly (need $2.00 for sustainability)
- **Investor Pressure**: Series C funding contingent on demonstrating sustainable unit economics

**Budget Limitations**:
- **Emergency Budget**: $100M available for infrastructure transformation
- **Operational Budget**: $30M monthly maximum for ongoing infrastructure costs

- **Communication Breakdown**: Engineering, product, and business teams misaligned on priorities
- **Process Gaps**: No formal change management, testing, or deployment procedures
- **Cultural Stress**: Startup culture struggling to adapt to enterprise-scale operational requirements

#### Regulatory and Compliance Constraints (Legal Reality)
**Regulatory Pressure**:
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR, CCPA compliance required for global user base
- **Content Moderation**: Government pressure for content filtering and user safety measures
- **Financial Regulations**: Payment processing compliance for in-app purchases and creator monetization
- **International Compliance**: Operating in 50+ countries with varying regulatory requirements

**Legal Risks**:

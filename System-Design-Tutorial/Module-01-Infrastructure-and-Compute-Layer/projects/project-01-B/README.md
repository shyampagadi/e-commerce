# Project 01-B: Multi-Environment Infrastructure

## Overview

Design development, testing, staging, and production environments with immutable infrastructure patterns and deployment pipelines.

## Objectives

- Design multi-environment architecture
- Implement immutable infrastructure patterns
- Create deployment pipelines between environments
- Design hybrid cloud infrastructure strategy

## Requirements

### 1. Environment Design
- **Development**: Developer testing environment
- **Testing**: Automated testing environment
- **Staging**: Production-like environment
- **Production**: Live production environment

### 2. Infrastructure Patterns
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: No changes after deployment
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments
- **Canary Deployment**: Gradual rollout strategy
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated provisioning

### 3. Deployment Pipeline
- **Source Control**: Git-based workflow
- **CI/CD**: Automated build and deployment
- **Testing**: Automated testing at each stage
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring and alerting

## Deliverables

### 1. Architecture Design
- Multi-environment architecture diagram
- Infrastructure patterns documentation
- Security and compliance requirements
- Cost optimization strategy

### 2. Implementation
- Infrastructure as code templates
- Deployment pipeline configuration
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Documentation and runbooks

### 3. Testing and Validation
- Environment testing procedures
- Performance validation
- Security testing
- Disaster recovery testing

## Success Criteria

- **Consistency**: All environments are consistent
- **Automation**: Fully automated deployments
- **Reliability**: Stable and reliable infrastructure
- **Security**: Meets security requirements

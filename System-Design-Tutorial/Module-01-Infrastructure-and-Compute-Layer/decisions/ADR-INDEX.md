## ADR Guidelines

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions that:
- Affect multiple components or modules
- Have long-term architectural implications
- Involve significant trade-offs
- Impact system performance, security, or maintainability
- Require coordination across teams

### ADR Naming Convention

Format: `{Module-Number}-{Sequence-Number}-{Short-Description}.md`

Examples:
- `01-001-compute-resource-selection.md`
- `01-002-auto-scaling-strategy.md`
- `01-003-container-orchestration-platform.md`

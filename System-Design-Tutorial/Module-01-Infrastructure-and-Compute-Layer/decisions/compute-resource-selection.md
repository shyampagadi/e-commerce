# ADR-01-001: Compute Resource Selection Criteria

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024-01-15

## Context
We need to establish criteria for selecting appropriate compute resources (VMs, containers, serverless) for different components of our system. This decision affects cost, performance, scalability, and operational complexity.

## Decision
We will use a multi-technology approach based on specific use cases:

### Virtual Machines (EC2)
- **Use Cases**: Legacy applications, stateful services, custom OS requirements
- **Instance Types**: t3.medium for web servers, r5.large for databases
- **Scaling**: Auto Scaling Groups with predictive and reactive policies
- **Cost Model**: Reserved Instances for predictable workloads

### Containers (ECS/EKS)
- **Use Cases**: Microservices, stateless applications, CI/CD pipelines
- **Platform**: ECS for simplicity, EKS for portability
- **Scaling**: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler based on CPU and memory
- **Cost Model**: Fargate for serverless containers

### Serverless (Lambda)
- **Use Cases**: Event-driven functions, API endpoints, data processing
- **Runtime**: Node.js, Python, Java
- **Scaling**: Automatic scaling up to 1000 concurrent executions
- **Cost Model**: Pay-per-request with free tier

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Optimized Performance**: Right tool for each use case
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for what you use
- **Scalability**: Each technology scales appropriately
- **Flexibility**: Can migrate between technologies

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Multiple technologies to manage
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs expertise in multiple areas
- **Operational Overhead**: Different monitoring and deployment tools
- **Vendor Lock-in**: AWS-specific implementations

### Neutral
- **Migration Path**: Can gradually migrate between technologies
- **Testing**: Need to test multiple deployment patterns

## Alternatives Considered

### Single Technology Approach
- **Rejected**: Would not optimize for different use cases
- **Reason**: One-size-fits-all approach is inefficient

### Cloud-Agnostic Approach
- **Rejected**: Would increase complexity without clear benefits
- **Reason**: AWS provides best-in-class managed services

## Implementation Notes

1. **Phase 1**: Start with VMs for core services
2. **Phase 2**: Containerize stateless services
3. **Phase 3**: Implement serverless for event-driven functions
4. **Phase 4**: Optimize based on usage patterns

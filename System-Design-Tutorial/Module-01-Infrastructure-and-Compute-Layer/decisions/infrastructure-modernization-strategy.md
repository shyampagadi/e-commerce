# ADR-005: Infrastructure Modernization Strategy

## Status
**Accepted** - 2023-09-10

## Context

Our organization is running legacy infrastructure that is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain, scale, and secure. We need to develop a comprehensive infrastructure modernization strategy that addresses:

- Legacy monolithic applications running on physical servers
- Manual deployment processes causing frequent outages
- Inability to scale quickly during traffic spikes
- High operational costs and maintenance overhead
- Security vulnerabilities in outdated systems
- Lack of disaster recovery and business continuity planning

### Current Infrastructure Challenges
```yaml
Legacy Infrastructure Issues:
  Physical Servers:
    - Average age: 5+ years
    - Utilization: 15-25% average
    - Maintenance cost: $500K annually
    - Downtime: 20+ hours per month

  Application Architecture:
    - Monolithic applications with tight coupling
    - Manual deployment processes
    - No automated testing or rollback capabilities
    - Single points of failure throughout the stack

  Operational Challenges:
    - Manual scaling processes taking 2-4 hours
    - No infrastructure as code
    - Limited monitoring and observability
    - Reactive rather than proactive maintenance

  Business Impact:
    - Customer satisfaction declining due to outages
    - Development velocity slowing due to deployment friction
    - Competitive disadvantage due to inability to innovate quickly
    - Increasing operational costs as systems age
```

## Decision

We will implement a phased infrastructure modernization strategy focusing on:

### 1. Cloud-First Architecture
- **Migration Strategy**: Lift-and-shift followed by re-architecting
- **Target Platform**: AWS with multi-region deployment
- **Hybrid Approach**: Gradual migration maintaining business continuity
- **Timeline**: 18-month complete migration

### 2. Containerization and Orchestration
- **Container Strategy**: Docker containerization for all applications
- **Orchestration Platform**: Amazon ECS with Fargate for serverless containers
- **Service Mesh**: AWS App Mesh for microservices communication
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated container builds and deployments

### 3. Infrastructure as Code
- **IaC Platform**: AWS CloudFormation with AWS CDK for complex logic
- **Version Control**: Git-based infrastructure versioning
- **Environment Management**: Automated dev/staging/production environments
- **Compliance**: Policy as code with AWS Config

### 4. Microservices Architecture
- **Decomposition Strategy**: Domain-driven design approach
- **API Management**: AWS API Gateway with comprehensive monitoring
- **Data Strategy**: Database per service with event-driven synchronization
- **Communication**: Asynchronous messaging with Amazon SQS/SNS

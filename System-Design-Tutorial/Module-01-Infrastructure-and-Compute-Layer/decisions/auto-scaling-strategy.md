# ADR-01-002: Auto-scaling Strategy and Policies

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024-01-15

## Context
We need to implement auto-scaling for our web application to handle variable traffic loads while optimizing costs. The system must scale up during peak hours and scale down during low usage periods.

## Decision
We will implement a hybrid auto-scaling strategy combining predictive and reactive scaling:

### Scaling Policies
- **Target Tracking**: CPU utilization at 70%, memory at 80%
- **Step Scaling**: Multiple scaling steps based on load
- **Scheduled Scaling**: Pre-scale for known traffic patterns
- **Predictive Scaling**: ML-based scaling for unknown patterns

### Scaling Configuration
- **Min Capacity**: 2 instances (for high availability)
- **Max Capacity**: 20 instances (cost control)
- **Desired Capacity**: 4 instances (baseline)
- **Cooldown Period**: 300 seconds (prevent thrashing)

### Scaling Metrics
- **Primary**: CPU utilization, memory utilization
- **Secondary**: Request count, response time
- **Custom**: Business metrics (active users, queue depth)

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Cost Optimization**: Scale down during low usage
- **Performance**: Scale up during high load
- **Availability**: Maintain service during traffic spikes
- **Automation**: Reduce manual intervention

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Multiple scaling policies to manage
- **Cold Starts**: Serverless functions may have cold starts
- **Cost Spikes**: Unexpected traffic can increase costs
- **Configuration**: Requires careful tuning

### Neutral
- **Monitoring**: Need comprehensive monitoring
- **Testing**: Must test scaling behavior

## Alternatives Considered

### Manual Scaling Only
- **Rejected**: Too slow for traffic spikes
- **Reason**: Cannot respond quickly enough to demand

### Reactive Scaling Only
- **Rejected**: Misses predictable patterns
- **Reason**: Predictive scaling is more efficient

### Fixed Capacity
- **Rejected**: Inefficient for variable workloads
- **Reason**: Over-provisioning wastes money

## Implementation Notes

1. **Phase 1**: Implement basic target tracking scaling
2. **Phase 2**: Add scheduled scaling for known patterns
3. **Phase 3**: Implement predictive scaling
4. **Phase 4**: Add custom business metrics

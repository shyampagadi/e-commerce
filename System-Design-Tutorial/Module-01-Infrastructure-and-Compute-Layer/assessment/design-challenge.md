# Module-01 Design Challenge

## Overview

This design challenge tests your ability to apply infrastructure and compute layer concepts to a real-world scenario.

## Challenge: Global Video Streaming Platform

### Business Context

You're designing infrastructure for a global video streaming platform that needs to handle:
- 50 million daily active users
- 1 billion video views per day
- Global content delivery
- Real-time transcoding
- Live streaming capabilities

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- **Video Upload**: Users can upload videos
- **Video Processing**: Transcode videos to multiple formats
- **Video Streaming**: Stream videos to users globally
- **Live Streaming**: Support live video streaming
- **User Management**: Handle user accounts and preferences

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Handle 10x traffic spikes
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Performance**: <2 seconds to start video playback
- **Global**: Serve users worldwide
- **Cost**: Optimize for cost efficiency

### Technical Constraints
- **Budget**: $1M per month infrastructure budget
- **Compliance**: GDPR and regional data requirements
- **Security**: Secure video content and user data
- **Integration**: Must integrate with existing systems

## Deliverables

### 1. Architecture Design
- **High-Level Architecture**: Overall system architecture
- **Component Design**: Detailed component specifications
- **Data Flow**: How data flows through the system
- **Security Design**: Security architecture and controls

### 2. Infrastructure Planning
- **Compute Resources**: Server types and configurations
- **Storage Strategy**: Video storage and caching
- **Network Design**: Global content delivery
- **Scaling Strategy**: Auto-scaling configuration

### 3. Implementation Plan
- **Deployment Strategy**: How to deploy the system
- **Monitoring**: Monitoring and alerting setup
- **Cost Analysis**: Detailed cost breakdown
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential risks and mitigation

## Success Criteria

- **Performance**: Meets performance requirements
- **Scalability**: Can handle traffic spikes
- **Cost**: Within budget constraints
- **Security**: Meets security requirements
- **Global**: Serves users worldwide effectively

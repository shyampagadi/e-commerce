**Your Role**: VP Infrastructure called in during crisis to save the business
**Stakes**: $50M in sales at risk, potential customer exodus to competitors

### The Crisis Unfolds: Real-Time Decision Making

#### 11:30 PM EST, November 28, 2024 - Crisis Begins
**Initial Alert**: Database connection timeouts causing game launch failures
**Business Context**: Black Friday gaming sales represent 40% of annual revenue
**Immediate Pressure**: CEO demanding updates every 15 minutes, customers flooding social media with complaints

#### 11:45 PM EST - Cascade Failure Accelerates
**Technical Escalation**: Payment processing failures, user authentication system overload
**Business Impact**: $2M in lost sales per hour, customer support overwhelmed
**Stakeholder Pressure**: Board members receiving customer complaints, media starting to report outages

#### 12:00 AM EST - Complete System Failure
**Total Outage**: All gaming services offline, 15M users unable to access platform
**Crisis Communication**: CEO on emergency call with board, demanding immediate resolution timeline
**Competitive Threat**: Competitors publicly offering discounts to GameStream customers

### Stakeholder Pressure Cooker

#### Sarah Chen - CEO (Ultimate Authority)
**Immediate Demand**: "I need the platform back online in 30 minutes or we're looking at bankruptcy. The board is asking if we need new technical leadership. What's your plan?"
**Business Context**: Company went public 6 months ago, stock price down 40% this quarter
**Personal Stakes**: CEO job security depends on successful Black Friday performance

#### Marcus Rodriguez - CFO (Financial Pressure)
**Cost Concern**: "Every minute of downtime costs us $33,000. We've already lost $2M. Whatever solution you propose cannot exceed our $10M emergency budget."
**Investor Relations**: "I have analysts calling asking if this is a systemic infrastructure problem. I need clear answers about our technical capabilities."

#### Jennifer Kim - Head of Customer Success (Customer Impact)
**Customer Crisis**: "We have 500,000 angry customers and counting. Customer support is completely overwhelmed. Social media sentiment is turning toxic."
**Retention Risk**: "Our biggest competitors are already reaching out to our customers. We could lose 20% of our user base if this continues."

#### David Park - Head of Engineering (Technical Reality)
**Team Status**: "Half my team is burned out from the last crisis 3 months ago. We're running on skeleton crew for the holiday weekend."
**Technical Constraints**: "Our infrastructure was designed for 5M concurrent users, but we're seeing 12M. The database can't handle this load."

#### Lisa Santos - Head of Business Development (Partner Impact)
**Partner Pressure**: "Our publishing partners are threatening to pull their games if we can't guarantee platform stability. We could lose $500M in partnership revenue."

# Module-01: Concept-Based Exercises

## Overview

These exercises focus on developing strategic thinking and architectural decision-making skills for infrastructure and compute systems. All exercises emphasize conceptual understanding, business alignment, and architectural reasoning without any code implementation.

## Exercise Philosophy

- **Strategic Architecture**: Focus on high-level decisions and their business impact
- **Trade-off Analysis**: Understand implications of different architectural choices
- **Business Alignment**: Connect technical decisions to business outcomes
- **Decision Frameworks**: Use structured approaches to evaluate options
- **Communication**: Present and defend architectural recommendations

## Exercise 1: Compute Strategy Selection Framework

### Business Scenario
TechStart, a SaaS company, currently runs on a single EC2 instance serving 1,000 users with $50K monthly revenue. They project 100x growth over 12 months, scaling to 100,000 users and $5M monthly revenue.

### Objective
Develop a comprehensive compute strategy that aligns with business growth while optimizing for cost, performance, and operational complexity.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Business Requirements Analysis
- Analyze current state and growth projections
- Identify critical business constraints and requirements
- Define success criteria for the compute strategy
- Assess organizational readiness for different approaches

#### Task 2: Compute Model Evaluation
Evaluate these compute approaches using a decision framework:
- **Traditional VMs**: Continued EC2-based approach with scaling
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes/ECS-based microservices
- **Serverless**: Lambda-based event-driven architecture
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combination of multiple compute models

#### Task 3: Strategic Recommendation
- Present recommended compute strategy with clear rationale
- Include phased implementation approach
- Address risk mitigation strategies
- Provide cost-benefit analysis

### Deliverables
- Business requirements analysis document
- Compute model comparison matrix with scoring

- Implementation roadmap with milestones

## Exercise 2: Scaling Strategy Design

### Business Scenario
E-commerce platform experiences seasonal traffic patterns: 10x traffic during holiday seasons, 3x during flash sales, baseline traffic rest of year. Current architecture struggles with these variations.

### Objective
Design a comprehensive scaling strategy that handles traffic variations efficiently while maintaining cost optimization and user experience.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Traffic Pattern Analysis
- Analyze different scaling scenarios and their characteristics
- Identify scaling triggers and thresholds
- Evaluate impact on different system components
- Assess user experience requirements during scaling events

#### Task 2: Scaling Approach Evaluation
Compare scaling strategies:
- **Vertical Scaling**: Scaling up individual resources
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Scaling out across multiple resources
- **Auto-scaling**: Automated scaling based on metrics
- **Predictive Scaling**: Proactive scaling based on forecasts

#### Task 3: Scaling Architecture Design
- Design scaling architecture for different traffic patterns
- Define scaling policies and decision criteria
- Plan capacity management approach
- Address scaling-related risks and mitigation strategies

### Deliverables
- Traffic pattern analysis and scaling requirements
- Scaling strategy comparison and selection rationale
- Scaling architecture design document
- Capacity management framework

## Exercise 3: Infrastructure Evolution Strategy

### Business Scenario
Legacy monolithic application on physical servers needs modernization. Company wants to move to cloud while maintaining business continuity and minimizing risk.

### Objective
Develop an infrastructure evolution strategy that modernizes the architecture while managing transformation risks and maintaining business operations.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Current State Assessment
- Analyze existing infrastructure and its limitations
- Identify modernization drivers and business objectives
- Assess organizational readiness for transformation
- Evaluate constraints and risk factors

#### Task 2: Target Architecture Design
- Define target cloud-native architecture
- Select appropriate modernization patterns (rehost, refactor, rebuild)
- Design migration approach and sequencing
- Plan for hybrid operation during transition

#### Task 3: Transformation Strategy
- Develop phased transformation roadmap
- Define success criteria and milestones
- Create risk management and mitigation plan
- Design rollback and contingency strategies

### Deliverables
- Current state assessment and gap analysis
- Target architecture design and rationale
- Transformation roadmap with risk assessment
- Success metrics and monitoring approach

## Exercise 4: Multi-Environment Strategy

### Business Scenario
Growing startup needs to establish proper development, testing, staging, and production environments while maintaining cost efficiency and operational simplicity.

### Objective
Design a multi-environment strategy that supports development velocity, quality assurance, and production stability while optimizing costs and operational overhead.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Environment Requirements Analysis
- Define requirements for each environment type
- Analyze data flow and promotion processes between environments
- Identify security and compliance requirements
- Assess resource and cost constraints

#### Task 2: Environment Architecture Design
- Design environment topology and isolation strategy
- Define environment provisioning and management approach
- Plan data management and synchronization strategy
- Design access control and security framework

#### Task 3: Operational Strategy
- Develop environment lifecycle management processes
- Create cost optimization strategies for non-production environments
- Design monitoring and alerting for all environments
- Plan disaster recovery for critical environments

### Deliverables
- Environment requirements and constraints analysis
- Multi-environment architecture design
- Operational processes and procedures
- Cost optimization and governance framework

## Exercise 5: Infrastructure Governance Framework

### Business Scenario
Mid-size company with multiple development teams needs to establish infrastructure governance to ensure consistency, security, and cost control while maintaining team autonomy.

### Objective
Develop an infrastructure governance framework that balances centralized control with team autonomy, ensuring security, compliance, and cost optimization.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Governance Requirements Analysis
- Identify governance drivers (security, compliance, cost control)
- Analyze organizational structure and team dynamics
- Define governance scope and boundaries
- Assess current governance gaps and challenges

#### Task 2: Governance Framework Design
- Design governance structure and decision-making processes
- Define standards, policies, and guidelines
- Create approval workflows and exception processes
- Plan governance tooling and automation strategy

#### Task 3: Implementation Strategy
- Develop governance rollout plan
- Design training and communication strategy
- Create compliance monitoring and reporting approach
- Plan governance framework evolution and improvement

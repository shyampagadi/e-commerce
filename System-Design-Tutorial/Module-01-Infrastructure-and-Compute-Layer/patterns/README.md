  - Solution: Horizontal Scaling Pattern with disposable instances

Manual Scaling:
  - Problem: Human intervention required for capacity changes
  - Solution: Auto Scaling Pattern with predictive scaling

Configuration Drift:

  - Solution: Automated Deployment Pipeline Pattern

No Rollback Strategy:

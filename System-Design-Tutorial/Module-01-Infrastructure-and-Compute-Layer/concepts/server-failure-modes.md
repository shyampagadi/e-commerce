# Server Failure Modes

## Overview

Understanding server failure modes is crucial for designing resilient systems. This document covers different types of failures, their detection, and mitigation strategies.

## Failure Types

### 1. Hardware Failures
- **CPU Failure**: Processor malfunction
- **Memory Failure**: RAM corruption or failure
- **Storage Failure**: Disk drive failure
- **Network Failure**: Network interface failure
- **Power Failure**: Power supply or UPS failure

### 2. Software Failures
- **Application Crash**: Software bug or exception
- **Operating System Crash**: Kernel panic or system halt
- **Memory Leak**: Gradual memory consumption increase
- **Resource Exhaustion**: CPU, memory, or disk space limits
- **Configuration Error**: Incorrect system configuration

### 3. Network Failures
- **Network Partition**: Network connectivity loss
- **DNS Failure**: Domain name resolution failure
- **Load Balancer Failure**: Traffic distribution failure
- **Firewall Failure**: Security policy enforcement failure

## Failure Detection

### 1. Health Checks
- **Liveness Probes**: Check if service is running
- **Readiness Probes**: Check if service is ready to serve traffic
- **Startup Probes**: Check if service has started successfully
- **Custom Health Checks**: Application-specific health indicators

### 2. Monitoring and Alerting
- **Metrics Collection**: CPU, memory, disk, network usage
- **Log Analysis**: Error logs, application logs
- **Performance Monitoring**: Response time, throughput
- **Alert Thresholds**: Set appropriate alert levels

### 3. Circuit Breakers
- **Open State**: Stop sending requests to failing service
- **Half-Open State**: Test if service has recovered
- **Closed State**: Normal operation
- **Failure Threshold**: Number of failures before opening

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Redundancy
- **N+1 Redundancy**: One extra server for each N servers
- **N+2 Redundancy**: Two extra servers for each N servers
- **Active-Active**: All servers handle traffic
- **Active-Passive**: Standby servers take over on failure

### 2. Failover Mechanisms
- **Automatic Failover**: System automatically switches to backup
- **Manual Failover**: Human intervention required
- **Graceful Degradation**: Reduce functionality instead of complete failure
- **Load Shedding**: Drop non-critical requests during overload

### 3. Recovery Procedures
- **Restart Strategy**: Restart failed components
- **Rollback Strategy**: Revert to previous working version
- **Data Recovery**: Restore from backups
- **Service Recovery**: Restore service functionality

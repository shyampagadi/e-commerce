# Resource Allocation Algorithms

## Overview

Resource allocation algorithms determine how computational resources are distributed and managed across different workloads and applications in a system.

## Key Algorithms

### 1. Bin Packing Algorithms
- **First Fit**: Place item in first bin that fits
- **Best Fit**: Place item in bin with smallest remaining space
- **Worst Fit**: Place item in bin with largest remaining space
- **Next Fit**: Place item in current bin, move to next if full

### 2. Load Balancing Algorithms
- **Round Robin**: Distribute requests evenly across servers
- **Weighted Round Robin**: Distribute based on server capacity
- **Least Connections**: Route to server with fewest active connections
- **Least Response Time**: Route to server with fastest response

### 3. Scheduling Algorithms
- **FIFO**: First In, First Out
- **Priority Scheduling**: Higher priority tasks first
- **Shortest Job First**: Execute shortest tasks first
- **Round Robin**: Time-sliced execution

## Resource Allocation Strategies

### 1. Static Allocation
- **Fixed Resources**: Pre-allocated resources
- **Predictable**: Known resource usage
- **Simple**: Easy to implement and manage
- **Wasteful**: May underutilize resources

### 2. Dynamic Allocation
- **On-Demand**: Allocate resources as needed
- **Efficient**: Better resource utilization
- **Complex**: Requires sophisticated algorithms
- **Variable**: Resource usage can fluctuate

### 3. Hybrid Allocation
- **Reserved + On-Demand**: Mix of both approaches
- **Balanced**: Good utilization and predictability
- **Flexible**: Adapt to changing requirements
- **Cost-Effective**: Optimize for cost and performance

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. Resource Pooling
- **Shared Resources**: Multiple applications share resources
- **Efficiency**: Better utilization of resources
- **Isolation**: Prevent resource conflicts
- **Monitoring**: Track resource usage

### 2. Resource Preemption
- **Priority-Based**: Higher priority tasks can preempt lower priority
- **Graceful Degradation**: Reduce resources for lower priority tasks
- **Fairness**: Ensure fair resource distribution
- **Recovery**: Restore resources when available

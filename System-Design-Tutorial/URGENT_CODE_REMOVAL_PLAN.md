**Action**: Replace with network architecture strategy frameworks

### 3. **Module 03 - Storage Systems**
**Files Requiring Complete Replacement**:

**Action**: Replace with storage strategy decision frameworks

### 4. **Module 04 - Database Design**
**Files Requiring Complete Replacement**:
- `projects/project-04-A/README.md` - Contains 20+ SQL CREATE TABLE statements
- `projects/project-04-B/README.md` - Contains database implementation code
- `projects/project-04-A/solution.md` - Contains complete schema implementations
- `projects/project-04-B/solution.md` - Contains polyglot database code
- `exercises/exercise-01-schema-design.md` - Contains SQL implementations

**Action**: Replace with database selection and modeling strategy frameworks

### 5. **Module 05 - Microservices**
**Files Requiring Review**:
- All exercise solution files - May contain service implementation code
- Project files - May contain microservice implementation examples

**Action**: Verify and replace any code with service design strategy frameworks

### 6. **Module 06 - Data Processing**
**Files Requiring Complete Replacement**:
- Exercise files likely contain pipeline implementation code
- Project files likely contain ETL/streaming code

**Action**: Replace with data architecture strategy frameworks

### 7. **Module 07 - Messaging Systems**
**Files Requiring Complete Replacement**:
- `exercises/exercise-01-message-queue-implementation.md` - Contains 500+ lines Python code
- `exercises/exercise-02-event-driven-microservices.md` - Likely contains implementation
- `exercises/exercise-03-high-throughput-streaming.md` - Likely contains streaming code
- All solution files contain messaging implementation code

**Action**: Replace with messaging architecture strategy frameworks

### 8. **Module 08 - Caching Strategies**
**Files Requiring Complete Replacement**:
- `projects/project-01-ecommerce-caching-platform.md` - Contains 400+ lines Python code
- `projects/project-02-real-time-analytics-platform.md` - Likely contains implementation
- `exercises/exercise-04-cache-consistency-models.md` - Likely contains code examples
- `exercises/exercise-05-cache-warming-strategies.md` - Likely contains implementation

**Action**: Replace with caching strategy decision frameworks

## Systematic Replacement Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Code Removal (Day 1)
1. **Backup existing files** with `.ORIGINAL` extension
2. **Create concept-based replacements** for all identified files
3. **Remove all code blocks** (```language blocks)
4. **Remove technical implementation instructions**

### Phase 2: Content Transformation (Days 2-3)
1. **Transform each exercise** to focus on strategic decision-making
2. **Transform each project** to focus on architectural design
3. **Transform each decision** to focus on business-aligned frameworks
4. **Ensure consistent concept-based approach** across all modules

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance (Day 4)
1. **Search for remaining code patterns**:
   - Search for "```" (code blocks)
   - Search for "CREATE TABLE", "def ", "class ", "function"
   - Search for "CloudFormation", "Terraform", "kubectl"
   - Search for implementation keywords

2. **Verify concept-based focus**:
   - All content focuses on strategic thinking
   - Business alignment is clear
   - No technical implementation required
   - Decision frameworks are emphasized

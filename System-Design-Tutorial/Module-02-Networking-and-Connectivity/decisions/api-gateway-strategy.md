# ADR-02-003: API Gateway Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our microservices platform has 15 services, handles 50K API requests/day (growing to 500K), serves mobile and web clients. Current direct service calls create security, monitoring, and client complexity issues. Need centralized API management solution.

## Decision
Implement AWS API Gateway with caching for external APIs, keeping internal service mesh for service-to-service communication.

## Concrete API Gateway Technology Comparison

### Gateway Options Evaluated
| Gateway | Type | Pricing Model | Max RPS | Latency Overhead | Best For |
|---------|------|---------------|---------|------------------|----------|
| **AWS API Gateway** | Managed | $3.50/million requests | 10K per region | 20-50ms | AWS-native apps |
| **Kong** | Self-hosted | $0 (OSS) + hosting | 50K+ | 5-15ms | High performance |
| **Nginx Plus** | Self-hosted | $2.5K/year | 100K+ | 2-10ms | Enterprise |
| **Zuul** | Self-hosted | Free | 20K+ | 10-30ms | Netflix stack |
| **Envoy Proxy** | Self-hosted | Free | 100K+ | 1-5ms | Service mesh |

## Decision Theory Framework Application

### Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)

#### Criteria Weighting Rationale
Based on organizational priorities and constraints:
- **Operational Simplicity (30%)**: Small DevOps team, limited operational capacity
- **Cost Year 1 (25%)**: Startup budget constraints, immediate cost impact
- **Team Fit (20%)**: Limited expertise, training costs significant
- **Performance (15%)**: Important but current load manageable
- **Feature Completeness (10%)**: Nice-to-have vs must-have distinction

#### Scoring Methodology

**Operational Simplicity Scoring (1-10)**:
- **10**: Fully managed, zero operational overhead
- **8-9**: Minimal setup, basic monitoring required
- **6-7**: Moderate setup, regular maintenance needed
- **4-5**: Complex setup, significant operational overhead
- **1-3**: Very complex, requires dedicated team

**Cost Scoring (1-10)**:
- **10**: <$500/month at current scale
- **8-9**: $500-1,500/month
- **6-7**: $1,500-3,000/month
- **4-5**: $3,000-5,000/month
- **1-3**: >$5,000/month

### Weighted Evaluation Results
| Criteria | Weight | AWS API Gateway | Kong | Nginx Plus |
|----------|--------|-----------------|------|------------|
| **Operational Simplicity** | 30% | 10/10 | 4/10 | 6/10 |

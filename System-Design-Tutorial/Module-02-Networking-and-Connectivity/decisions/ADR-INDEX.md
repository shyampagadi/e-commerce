# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) - Module 02

## Overview
This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Module-02: Networking and Connectivity. ADRs document important architectural decisions made for networking infrastructure and connectivity solutions.

## ADR Status Legend
- **Proposed**: Decision is under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Current ADRs for Module-02

### ADR-02-001: Load Balancer Selection Strategy
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Use ALB for HTTP/HTTPS traffic and NLB for TCP/UDP traffic
- **Rationale**: Optimizes performance and cost for different traffic types
- **File**: [load-balancer-selection.md](./load-balancer-selection.md)

### ADR-02-002: Network Security Architecture
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Implement defense-in-depth security with multiple security layers
- **Rationale**: Provides comprehensive protection against various threat vectors
- **File**: [network-security-architecture.md](./network-security-architecture.md)

### ADR-02-003: API Gateway Strategy
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Use centralized API Gateway with distributed caching
- **Rationale**: Enables consistent API management and improved performance
- **File**: [api-gateway-strategy.md](./api-gateway-strategy.md)

### ADR-02-004: Content Delivery Network (CDN) Architecture
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Implement multi-tier CDN with intelligent caching policies
- **Rationale**: Optimizes global content delivery and reduces origin load
- **File**: [cdn-architecture.md](./cdn-architecture.md)

### ADR-02-005: Network Monitoring and Observability
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Implement comprehensive network monitoring with real-time alerting
- **Rationale**: Enables proactive issue detection and performance optimization
- **File**: [network-monitoring-strategy.md](./network-monitoring-strategy.md)

## Guidelines for Creating ADRs

### When to Create an ADR
- Network architecture decisions affecting multiple services
- Load balancing and traffic routing strategies
- Security architecture and policy decisions
- API gateway and service mesh configurations
- CDN and content delivery strategies

### ADR Template
Use the following template for new ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-02-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded]

## Context
[Background and problem statement]

## Decision
[The architectural decision made]

## Rationale
[Why this decision was made]

## Consequences
[Positive and negative consequences]

## Alternatives Considered
[Other options that were considered]

## Implementation Notes
[How to implement this decision]

## Related ADRs
[Links to related ADRs]
```

### Naming Convention
- Format: `ADR-02-XXX-descriptive-name.md`
- XXX: Three-digit number (001, 002, 003, etc.)
- Use kebab-case for descriptive name

## Review Process

### ADR Review Steps
1. **Draft**: Create ADR with proposed status
2. **Review**: Network team reviews the ADR
3. **Discussion**: Address feedback and concerns
4. **Approval**: Change status to accepted
5. **Implementation**: Implement the decision
6. **Monitoring**: Monitor consequences and update if needed

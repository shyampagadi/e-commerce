# ADR-02-004: Content Delivery Network (CDN) Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
CDN architecture decisions significantly impact global performance, cost optimization, and user experience. Different CDN strategies have varying trade-offs between performance gains, implementation complexity, and operational costs. A systematic framework is needed to determine optimal CDN investment and architecture.

## Decision
Implement a multi-tier CDN architecture using a performance-cost optimization framework that balances global delivery requirements with budget constraints and operational complexity.

## CDN Strategy Decision Framework

### Core Decision Question
**"What CDN architecture provides optimal global performance improvement while maintaining acceptable cost and operational complexity for our specific user distribution and content types?"**

# ADR-02-001: Network Architecture Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Designing network architecture for a global e-commerce platform serving 1M+ users across 3 regions, requiring 99.9% availability, sub-100ms response times, and support for mobile/web clients with varying connectivity patterns.

## Business Drivers
- **Global Expansion**: Serve customers in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific
- **Performance Requirements**: Sub-100ms response times for critical user journeys
- **Availability Goals**: 99.9% uptime with minimal regional impact during outages
- **Cost Optimization**: Balance performance requirements with infrastructure costs
- **Security Compliance**: Meet regional data protection and security requirements

## Decision Framework: Network Architecture Selection

### Architecture Options Evaluated

#### Option 1: Single-Region Centralized Architecture
**Approach**: All services hosted in single AWS region with global CDN
**Pros**: 
- Simplified operations and data consistency
- Lower initial complexity and cost
- Easier compliance and governance

**Cons**:
- High latency for distant users (200-300ms)
- Single point of failure for entire platform
- Limited disaster recovery options
- Poor user experience in remote regions

**Business Impact**: Cost-effective but poor user experience, limits global growth

#### Option 2: Multi-Region Active-Passive Architecture  
**Approach**: Primary region with passive disaster recovery regions
**Pros**:
- Improved disaster recovery capabilities
- Better latency for users near primary region
- Moderate operational complexity

**Cons**:
- Still high latency for users in passive regions
- Underutilized infrastructure in passive regions
- Complex failover procedures
- Data synchronization challenges

**Business Impact**: Better resilience but suboptimal global performance

#### Option 3: Multi-Region Active-Active Architecture
**Approach**: Multiple active regions serving local users with data replication
**Pros**:
- Optimal latency for all global users
- High availability and disaster recovery
- Efficient resource utilization
- Scalable for global growth

**Cons**:
- High operational complexity
- Data consistency challenges
- Higher infrastructure costs
- Complex routing and load balancing

**Business Impact**: Best user experience enabling global growth, higher operational investment

#### Option 4: Hybrid Edge-Cloud Architecture
**Approach**: Core services in regions with edge computing for performance-critical functions
**Pros**:
- Ultra-low latency for critical operations
- Efficient bandwidth utilization
- Flexible scaling based on demand
- Future-ready architecture

**Cons**:
- Highest complexity and operational overhead
- Limited edge computing maturity
- Vendor lock-in concerns
- Higher initial investment

**Business Impact**: Cutting-edge performance but significant complexity and cost

#### Scoring Matrix (1-10 scale)
| Option | User Experience | Scalability | Operational Complexity | Cost Efficiency | Risk Management | Weighted Score |
|--------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Single-Region | 3 | 4 | 9 | 9 | 2 | 5.25 |
| Active-Passive | 6 | 7 | 6 | 7 | 7 | 6.4 |
| **Active-Active** | **9** | **9** | **4** | **5** | **8** | **7.35** |
| Hybrid Edge | 10 | 10 | 2 | 3 | 6 | 6.9 |

## Decision
**Selected Architecture**: Multi-Region Active-Active with phased implementation

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
- Establish primary region with full functionality
- Implement global CDN for static content
- Design data replication architecture
- Establish monitoring and observability framework

#### Phase 2: Regional Expansion (Months 4-8)  
- Deploy secondary region with active services
- Implement cross-region data replication
- Configure intelligent traffic routing
- Establish regional failover capabilities

#### Phase 3: Optimization (Months 9-12)
- Fine-tune performance and routing policies
- Implement advanced caching strategies
- Optimize data placement and replication
- Enhance monitoring and alerting

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Operational Complexity Management
- **Strategy**: Invest in automation and infrastructure-as-code
- **Approach**: Standardized deployment pipelines and configuration management
- **Timeline**: Parallel development with architecture implementation

#### Data Consistency Challenges
- **Strategy**: Implement eventual consistency with conflict resolution
- **Approach**: Design application logic to handle distributed data scenarios
- **Monitoring**: Real-time replication lag and consistency monitoring

#### Cost Management
- **Strategy**: Implement cost monitoring and optimization processes
- **Approach**: Regular cost reviews and resource right-sizing
- **Controls**: Automated cost alerts and budget governance

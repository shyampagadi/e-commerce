# ADR-02-005: Network Monitoring and Observability Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Network infrastructure requires comprehensive monitoring to ensure optimal performance, security, and reliability. Without proper observability, network issues can go undetected, leading to poor user experience, security vulnerabilities, and operational challenges.

## Decision
Implement a comprehensive network monitoring and observability strategy with the following components:

### Monitoring Layers
1. **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Network devices, connections, and physical infrastructure
2. **Traffic Monitoring**: Network flows, bandwidth utilization, and traffic patterns
3. **Application Performance**: End-to-end application performance and user experience
4. **Security Monitoring**: Threat detection, anomaly identification, and compliance

### Monitoring Tools and Services
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Primary monitoring and alerting platform
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Network traffic analysis and security monitoring
- **AWS X-Ray**: Distributed tracing for application performance
- **AWS GuardDuty**: Threat detection and security monitoring
- **Third-party Tools**: Specialized monitoring for specific use cases

### Observability Pillars
1. **Metrics**: Quantitative measurements of network performance
2. **Logs**: Detailed records of network events and transactions
3. **Traces**: End-to-end request flow analysis
4. **Alerts**: Proactive notification of issues and anomalies

## Rationale
This strategy provides:
- **Proactive Issue Detection**: Identify problems before they impact users
- **Performance Optimization**: Data-driven insights for network optimization
- **Security Visibility**: Comprehensive threat detection and response
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated monitoring reduces manual oversight
- **Compliance**: Audit trails and compliance reporting capabilities
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Detailed data for troubleshooting and resolution

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved network reliability and performance
- Faster incident detection and resolution
- Enhanced security posture and threat response
- Better capacity planning and resource optimization
- Reduced operational overhead through automation
- Improved compliance and audit readiness

### Negative
- Additional complexity in monitoring infrastructure
- Increased costs for monitoring tools and data storage
- Potential alert fatigue if not properly tuned
- Need for specialized skills in monitoring and analysis
- Data privacy and retention considerations

## Alternatives Considered

### Basic CloudWatch Monitoring Only
- **Pros**: Simple setup, integrated with AWS
- **Cons**: Limited visibility, basic alerting capabilities
- **Rejected**: Insufficient for comprehensive network monitoring

### Third-Party Monitoring Solution Only
- **Pros**: Advanced features, specialized capabilities
- **Cons**: Additional costs, integration complexity
- **Partially Adopted**: Use for specialized monitoring needs

### Manual Monitoring Approach
- **Pros**: Full control, no additional tools
- **Cons**: Not scalable, prone to human error
- **Rejected**: Not feasible for modern infrastructure scale

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure Monitoring (Week 1)
```yaml
CloudWatch Metrics:
  - Network interface metrics (bytes in/out, packets, errors)
  - Load balancer metrics (request count, latency, errors)
  - VPC metrics (NAT gateway, VPN connections)
  - DNS query metrics (Route 53)

Basic Alarms:
  - High network utilization (>80%)
  - Load balancer error rate (>5%)
  - VPN connection failures
  - DNS resolution failures
```

### Phase 2: Traffic Analysis and Flow Monitoring (Week 2)
```yaml
VPC Flow Logs:
  - Enable flow logs for all VPCs and subnets
  - Configure log delivery to S3 and CloudWatch
  - Set up automated analysis with Athena
  - Create dashboards for traffic visualization

Traffic Analysis:
  - Top talkers identification
  - Unusual traffic pattern detection
  - Bandwidth utilization trends
  - Protocol distribution analysis
```

### Phase 3: Application Performance Monitoring (Week 3)
```yaml
X-Ray Tracing:
  - Enable tracing for all applications
  - Configure sampling rules for cost optimization
  - Set up service maps for dependency visualization
  - Create performance analysis dashboards

Real User Monitoring:
  - Client-side performance metrics
  - Geographic performance analysis
  - Device and browser performance
  - Core Web Vitals tracking
```

### Phase 4: Security and Compliance Monitoring (Week 4)
```yaml
GuardDuty Configuration:
  - Enable GuardDuty in all regions
  - Configure threat intelligence feeds
  - Set up automated response workflows
  - Integrate with SIEM systems

Security Monitoring:
  - Unusual network activity detection
  - Failed authentication attempts
  - Data exfiltration patterns
  - Compliance violation alerts
```

  - Bandwidth utilization
  - Packet loss rate
  - Connection success rate

Availability KPIs:
  - Network uptime percentage
  - Service availability
  - Mean time to detection (MTTD)
  - Mean time to resolution (MTTR)

Security KPIs:
  - Security incidents detected
  - False positive rate
  - Threat response time
  - Compliance score
```

### Alerting Strategy
```yaml
Alert Severity Levels:
  Critical:
    - Network outages
    - Security breaches
    - Service unavailability
    Response: Immediate (< 5 minutes)
    
  High:
    - Performance degradation
    - Capacity thresholds
    - Security anomalies
    Response: Within 15 minutes
    
  Medium:
    - Trend deviations
    - Capacity warnings
    - Configuration changes
    Response: Within 1 hour
    
  Low:
    - Informational alerts
    - Maintenance notifications
    - Optimization opportunities
    Response: Next business day
```

### Automated Response Actions
```yaml
Network Issues:
  - Auto-scaling trigger for high utilization
  - Failover to backup connections
  - Traffic rerouting for congestion
  - Service restart for connection issues

Security Events:
  - Automatic IP blocking for threats
  - Account lockout for brute force
  - Quarantine for infected systems
  - Incident ticket creation
```

### Data Retention and Storage
```yaml
Retention Policies:
  - Real-time metrics: 15 months
  - Flow logs: 90 days in hot storage, 7 years in archive
  - Application traces: 30 days
  - Security logs: 7 years for compliance

Storage Optimization:
  - Compress logs before archival
  - Use lifecycle policies for cost optimization
  - Implement data tiering strategies
  - Regular cleanup of obsolete data

# ADR-02-002: Network Security Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Network security architecture requires systematic decision-making to balance protection, performance, and operational complexity. Different threat models and business requirements demand different security approaches and investment levels.

## Decision
Implement a defense-in-depth security architecture using a risk-based decision framework for security control selection and layering.

## Security Architecture Decision Framework

### Core Decision Question
**"What level of security investment provides optimal risk reduction for our specific threat model and business context?"**

### Security Investment Decision Matrix
| Security Layer | Implementation Cost | Operational Overhead | Risk Reduction | Business Impact | Priority Score |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Perimeter Security** | Medium | Low | High | High | **8.5** |
| **Network Segmentation** | Low | Medium | High | Medium | **7.5** |
| **Access Control** | Medium | High | Very High | High | **8.0** |
| **Traffic Monitoring** | High | High | Medium | Medium | **6.0** |
| **Endpoint Security** | Medium | Medium | High | High | **7.5** |

**Scoring**: Cost/Overhead (1-3 Low, 4-6 Medium, 7-9 High), Risk Reduction/Impact (1-3 Low, 4-6 Medium, 7-9 High, 10 Very High)

### Threat Model Decision Matrix
| Threat Category | Probability | Impact | Risk Score | Security Controls Required |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|------------|---------------------------|
| **DDoS Attacks** | High (8) | High (8) | **64** | WAF, Rate Limiting, CDN |
| **Data Breach** | Medium (6) | Very High (9) | **54** | Encryption, Access Control, Monitoring |
| **Insider Threats** | Medium (5) | High (7) | **35** | Zero Trust, Audit Logging, Segmentation |
| **Malware** | High (7) | Medium (6) | **42** | Endpoint Protection, Network Filtering |
| **Social Engineering** | Medium (6) | Medium (6) | **36** | Training, MFA, Process Controls |

### Security Control Selection Framework

#### Defense-in-Depth Decision Tree
```
Security Requirements Assessment
├── External Threats (Internet-facing)
│   ├── High Volume Expected → DDoS Protection + WAF
│   ├── Sensitive Data → Encryption + Access Control
│   └── Standard Risk → Basic Firewall + Monitoring
├── Internal Threats (Network segmentation)
│   ├── Zero Trust Required → Micro-segmentation + Identity
│   ├── Compliance Required → Network ACLs + Logging
│   └── Standard Security → VPC + Security Groups
└── Data Protection Requirements
    ├── Regulatory Compliance → Encryption + Audit Trail
    ├── Business Critical → Backup + Access Control
    └── Standard Data → Basic Protection
```

#### Security Control Trade-off Matrix
| Security Control | Security Benefit | Performance Impact | Cost | Complexity | Recommendation |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|------|------------|----------------|
| **WAF** | High | Low | Medium | Low | Implement |
| **DDoS Protection** | High | None | High | Low | Implement if high-risk |
| **Network Segmentation** | High | None | Low | Medium | Implement |
| **Zero Trust** | Very High | Medium | High | High | Evaluate carefully |
| **SIEM** | Medium | Low | High | High | Implement if compliance required |

| **Detective** | Low | High | Medium | Low | **Medium** |
| **Corrective** | Low | Low | High | Medium | **Medium** |
| **Compensating** | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium | **High** |

### Compliance Requirements Decision Framework
| Regulation | Security Requirements | Implementation Priority | Cost Impact |
|------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **GDPR** | Data encryption, access logging | High | Medium |
| **SOX** | Financial data protection, audit trails | High | High |
| **HIPAA** | Healthcare data encryption, access control | High | High |
| **PCI DSS** | Payment data protection, network segmentation | High | Very High |

- **Decision**: Reference for control selection, customize based on risk

### Minimal Security
- **Pros**: Low cost, simple implementation
- **Cons**: Inadequate protection for most business contexts
- **Decision**: Rejected - insufficient for modern threat landscape

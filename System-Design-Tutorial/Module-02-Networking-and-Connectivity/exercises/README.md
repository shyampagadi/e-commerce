# Module 02 Exercises

## Exercise 1: Network Latency Analysis
Measure and compare latency across different AWS networking services.

**Objective**: Understand performance characteristics of ALB, NLB, and CloudFront.

**Tasks**:
1. Set up test endpoints for each service
2. Measure latency from multiple regions
3. Analyze results and identify optimal configuration

## Exercise 2: Load Balancer Configuration
Configure and test different load balancing algorithms.

**Objective**: Compare round-robin, least connections, and weighted routing.

**Tasks**:
1. Deploy backend services with different capacities
2. Configure load balancer with different algorithms
3. Test traffic distribution and performance

## Exercise 3: CDN Cache Optimization
Optimize CloudFront cache settings for different content types.

**Objective**: Achieve >90% cache hit rate while maintaining content freshness.

**Tasks**:
1. Configure cache behaviors for static/dynamic content
2. Set appropriate TTL values
3. Monitor cache hit rates and optimize

## Exercise 4: Global DNS Configuration
Set up Route 53 with latency-based routing.

**Objective**: Route users to nearest healthy endpoint.

**Tasks**:
1. Configure health checks for multiple regions
2. Set up latency-based routing policies
3. Test failover scenarios

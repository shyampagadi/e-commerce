- **Performance Profile**: 50-100ms additional latency for Layer 7 processing
- **Use Cases**: Complex routing requirements, SSL offloading, content-based routing
- **Business Alignment**: Optimal for e-commerce with diverse traffic patterns

**Network Load Balancer (NLB) Analysis**:
- **Strengths**: Ultra-low latency, high throughput, Layer 4 processing
- **Performance Profile**: <10ms additional latency, millions of requests per second
- **Use Cases**: High-performance applications, TCP/UDP traffic, minimal latency requirements
- **Business Alignment**: Ideal for payment processing and real-time features

**CloudFront CDN Analysis**:
- **Strengths**: Global edge locations, content caching, DDoS protection
- **Performance Profile**: 200-500ms latency reduction for cached content
- **Use Cases**: Static content delivery, global user base, content optimization
- **Business Alignment**: Critical for global e-commerce performance

#### Strategic Architecture Recommendation

**Hybrid Network Architecture**:
1. **Edge Layer**: CloudFront for static content and global acceleration
2. **Application Layer**: ALB for complex routing and SSL termination
3. **Service Layer**: NLB for high-performance backend services
4. **Regional Distribution**: Multi-region deployment for disaster recovery

**Business Justification**:
- **Performance**: Optimized latency for different traffic types
- **Cost**: Balanced approach avoiding over-engineering

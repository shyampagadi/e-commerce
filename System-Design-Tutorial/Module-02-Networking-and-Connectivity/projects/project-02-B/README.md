# Project 02-B: Multi-Region Load Balancing Architecture

## Project Overview
Design a multi-region load balancing solution for a high-traffic web application.

## Requirements
- **Traffic**: Handle 100,000 requests/second
- **Regions**: Deploy across 3 AWS regions
- **Failover**: Automatic regional failover <30 seconds
- **Security**: SSL termination and DDoS protection

## Deliverables
1. **Network Architecture**: Multi-region topology design
2. **Load Balancer Configuration**: ALB/NLB setup with health checks
3. **Auto Scaling**: Dynamic scaling based on traffic patterns
4. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time performance metrics
5. **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Failover procedures and testing

## Success Criteria
- Handle peak traffic without degradation
- Regional failover <30 seconds
- 99.99% availability across all regions
- Cost-optimized resource allocation

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Architecture design and capacity planning
- **Week 2**: Multi-region deployment
- **Week 3**: Load testing and optimization

# Project 02-A: Global Content Delivery Network

## Project Overview
Design and implement a global CDN architecture for a media streaming service.

## Requirements
- **Global Reach**: Serve content to users in 5+ regions
- **Performance**: <100ms latency for 95% of users
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime with automatic failover
- **Cost**: Optimize for $0.05/GB data transfer

## Deliverables
1. **Architecture Diagram**: Global CDN topology
2. **CloudFront Configuration**: Distribution settings and behaviors
3. **Route 53 Setup**: DNS routing and health checks
4. **Performance Report**: Latency measurements and optimization results
5. **Cost Analysis**: Monthly cost breakdown and optimization strategies

## Success Criteria
- Cache hit rate >90%
- Global latency <100ms (P95)
- Cost within budget constraints
- Automated failover working correctly

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Architecture design and AWS setup
- **Week 2**: Implementation and testing
- **Week 3**: Optimization and documentation

# Cache Performance Calculations

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive calculations for cache performance metrics, cost optimization, and capacity planning in real-world scenarios.

## Cache Hit Ratio Calculations

### Basic Hit Ratio Formula

**Formula**
```
Hit Ratio = (Cache Hits) / (Cache Hits + Cache Misses)
```

**Example Calculation**
- Cache Hits: 8,500,000
- Cache Misses: 1,500,000
- Total Requests: 10,000,000
- Hit Ratio = 8,500,000 / 10,000,000 = 0.85 = 85%

### Hit Ratio Impact on Performance

**Response Time Calculation**
```
Average Response Time = (Hit Ratio × Cache Response Time) + 
                       ((1 - Hit Ratio) × Database Response Time)
```

**Example**
- Hit Ratio: 85%
- Cache Response Time: 5ms
- Database Response Time: 100ms
- Average Response Time = (0.85 × 5) + (0.15 × 100) = 4.25 + 15 = 19.25ms

### Hit Ratio Optimization

**Target Hit Ratios by Data Type**
- **Static Content**: 95-98%
- **User Data**: 85-95%
- **Dynamic Content**: 70-85%
- **Real-time Data**: 60-80%

## Cache Size Calculations

### Memory Requirements

**Basic Memory Calculation**
```
Memory Required = (Number of Items) × (Average Item Size) × (Overhead Factor)
```

**Example**
- Number of Items: 1,000,000
- Average Item Size: 2KB
- Overhead Factor: 1.2 (20% overhead)
- Memory Required = 1,000,000 × 2KB × 1.2 = 2.4GB

### Cache Capacity Planning

**Capacity Planning Formula**
```
Cache Size = (Peak Requests per Second) × (Average Response Size) × 
             (Cache Duration in Seconds) × (Safety Factor)
```

**Example**
- Peak Requests per Second: 10,000
- Average Response Size: 5KB
- Cache Duration: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- Safety Factor: 1.5
- Cache Size = 10,000 × 5KB × 300 × 1.5 = 22.5GB

## Cost Calculations

### Infrastructure Costs

**Monthly Cost Calculation**
```
Monthly Cost = (Instance Cost per Hour) × (Hours per Month) × (Number of Instances)
```

**Example**
- Instance Cost: $0.50/hour
- Hours per Month: 720
- Number of Instances: 10
- Monthly Cost = $0.50 × 720 × 10 = $3,600

### Cost per Request

**Cost per Request Formula**
```
Cost per Request = (Monthly Infrastructure Cost) / (Monthly Request Volume)
```

**Example**
- Monthly Infrastructure Cost: $3,600
- Monthly Request Volume: 100,000,000
- Cost per Request = $3,600 / 100,000,000 = $0.000036

### ROI Calculation

**ROI Formula**
```
ROI = ((Savings - Costs) / Costs) × 100
```

**Example**
- Database Cost without Cache: $10,000/month
- Database Cost with Cache: $3,000/month
- Cache Infrastructure Cost: $2,000/month
- Savings = $10,000 - $3,000 = $7,000
- Costs = $2,000
- ROI = (($7,000 - $2,000) / $2,000) × 100 = 250%

## Performance Metrics Calculations

### Throughput Calculations

**Requests per Second**
```
RPS = (Total Requests) / (Time Period in Seconds)
```

**Example**
- Total Requests: 1,000,000
- Time Period: 1 hour = 3,600 seconds
- RPS = 1,000,000 / 3,600 = 277.78 RPS

### Latency Calculations

**Percentile Latency**
```
P95 Latency = Value at 95th percentile of sorted latency values
P99 Latency = Value at 99th percentile of sorted latency values
```

**Average Latency**
```
Average Latency = Sum of all latencies / Number of requests
```

### Bandwidth Calculations

**Bandwidth Usage**
```
Bandwidth = (Data Size) × (Number of Requests) / (Time Period)
```

**Example**
- Data Size: 5KB per request
- Number of Requests: 100,000
- Time Period: 1 hour = 3,600 seconds
- Bandwidth = (5KB × 100,000) / 3,600 = 138.89 KB/s

## Cache Warming Calculations

### Warming Time Estimation

**Warming Time Formula**
```
Warming Time = (Cache Size) / (Warming Rate)
```

**Example**
- Cache Size: 10GB
- Warming Rate: 100MB/s
- Warming Time = 10GB / 100MB/s = 100 seconds

### Warming Cost Calculation

**Warming Cost**
```
Warming Cost = (Warming Time) × (Infrastructure Cost per Second)
```

**Example**
- Warming Time: 100 seconds
- Infrastructure Cost: $0.50/hour = $0.000139/second
- Warming Cost = 100 × $0.000139 = $0.0139

## Cache Invalidation Calculations

### Invalidation Frequency

**Invalidation Rate**
```
Invalidation Rate = (Number of Invalidations) / (Time Period)
```

**Example**
- Number of Invalidations: 1,000
- Time Period: 1 hour = 3,600 seconds
- Invalidation Rate = 1,000 / 3,600 = 0.278 invalidations/second

### Invalidation Cost

**Invalidation Cost**
```
Invalidation Cost = (Invalidation Rate) × (Cost per Invalidation)
```

**Example**
- Invalidation Rate: 0.278/second
- Cost per Invalidation: $0.001
- Invalidation Cost = 0.278 × $0.001 = $0.000278/second

## Scaling Calculations

### Horizontal Scaling

**Scaling Factor**
```
Scaling Factor = (Target Load) / (Current Load)
```

**Example**
- Target Load: 50,000 RPS
- Current Load: 10,000 RPS
- Scaling Factor = 50,000 / 10,000 = 5

### Vertical Scaling

**Resource Utilization**
```
Resource Utilization = (Current Usage) / (Total Capacity) × 100
```

**Example**
- Current Usage: 8GB
- Total Capacity: 16GB
- Resource Utilization = 8 / 16 × 100 = 50%

## Capacity Planning Calculations

### Peak Load Planning

**Peak Load Calculation**
```
Peak Load = (Average Load) × (Peak Factor)
```

**Example**
- Average Load: 10,000 RPS
- Peak Factor: 3
- Peak Load = 10,000 × 3 = 30,000 RPS

### Growth Planning

**Growth Projection**
```
Future Load = (Current Load) × (1 + Growth Rate)^Time Period
```

**Example**
- Current Load: 10,000 RPS
- Growth Rate: 20% per year
- Time Period: 2 years
- Future Load = 10,000 × (1 + 0.20)^2 = 14,400 RPS

## Cost Optimization Calculations

### Cost per GB

**Cost per GB Calculation**
```
Cost per GB = (Monthly Cost) / (Storage in GB)
```

**Example**
- Monthly Cost: $1,000
- Storage: 100GB
- Cost per GB = $1,000 / 100GB = $10/GB

### Cost per Request

**Cost per Request**
```
Cost per Request = (Monthly Cost) / (Monthly Requests)
```

**Example**
- Monthly Cost: $5,000
- Monthly Requests: 50,000,000
- Cost per Request = $5,000 / 50,000,000 = $0.0001

## Performance Optimization Calculations

### Cache Efficiency

**Cache Efficiency**
```
Cache Efficiency = (Cache Hit Ratio) × (Cache Performance Improvement)
```

**Example**
- Cache Hit Ratio: 85%
- Cache Performance Improvement: 10x faster
- Cache Efficiency = 0.85 × 10 = 8.5x improvement

### Memory Efficiency

**Memory Efficiency**
```
Memory Efficiency = (Useful Data) / (Total Memory) × 100
```

**Example**
- Useful Data: 8GB
- Total Memory: 10GB
- Memory Efficiency = 8 / 10 × 100 = 80%

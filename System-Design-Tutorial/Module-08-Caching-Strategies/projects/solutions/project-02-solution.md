**Tier 2: Application-Level Caching**
- **Purpose**: Cache processed analytics results and aggregations
- **Technology**: Redis Cluster with read replicas
- **TTL**: 5-60 minutes based on data update frequency
- **Pattern**: Cache-aside with write-through for critical data

**Tier 3: Database Query Caching**
- **Purpose**: Cache complex analytical queries and aggregations
- **Technology**: Database query result caching
- **TTL**: 1-30 minutes based on query complexity
- **Pattern**: Read-through with intelligent invalidation

### Data Classification and Caching Strategy

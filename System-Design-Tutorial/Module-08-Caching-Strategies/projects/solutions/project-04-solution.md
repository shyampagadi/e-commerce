# Project 4 Solution: Microservices Caching Architecture Strategy

## Solution Overview

This solution provides a comprehensive caching strategy for a microservices architecture with 100+ services, handling 1M+ requests per second with complex data dependencies and consistency requirements.

## Architecture Design

### Multi-Service Caching Architecture

**Service-Level Caching**
- **Purpose**: Cache service-specific data and responses
- **Technology**: Redis Cluster per service
- **Pattern**: Cache-aside with intelligent invalidation
- **Consistency**: Eventual consistency with conflict resolution

**Cross-Service Caching**
- **Purpose**: Cache data shared across multiple services
- **Technology**: Distributed Redis Cluster
- **Pattern**: Write-through with event-driven invalidation
- **Consistency**: Strong consistency for critical data

**API Gateway Caching**
- **Purpose**: Cache API responses and reduce service load
- **Technology**: API Gateway with integrated caching
- **Pattern**: Read-through with TTL-based invalidation
- **Consistency**: Eventual consistency acceptable

### Data Dependency Management

**Service Dependencies**
- **User Service**: User profiles, authentication data
- **Product Service**: Product catalogs, inventory data
- **Order Service**: Order history, payment data
- **Analytics Service**: Usage metrics, performance data

**Cache Dependency Graph**
- **Primary Dependencies**: Direct service-to-service data dependencies
- **Secondary Dependencies**: Indirect dependencies through shared data
- **Circular Dependencies**: Handle circular references with conflict resolution
- **Dependency Invalidation**: Cascade invalidation across dependent services

## Performance Optimization Strategy

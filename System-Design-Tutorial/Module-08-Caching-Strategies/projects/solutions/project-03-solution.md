## Solution Overview

This solution provides a comprehensive caching strategy for a global CDN serving 1PB+ content daily with 99.99% availability requirements across 200+ edge locations.

## Architecture Design

### Global CDN Architecture

**Edge Layer (200+ Locations)**
- **Purpose**: Serve content from locations closest to users
- **Technology**: Custom CDN nodes with intelligent caching
- **Coverage**: Global distribution with regional optimization
- **Capacity**: 10TB+ per edge location

**Regional Aggregation Layer (20+ Locations)**
- **Purpose**: Aggregate and distribute content to edge locations
- **Technology**: High-performance caching servers
- **Coverage**: Regional hubs for content distribution
- **Capacity**: 100TB+ per regional location

**Origin Layer (5+ Locations)**
- **Purpose**: Store and serve original content
- **Technology**: Distributed origin servers with replication
- **Coverage**: Global origin distribution
- **Capacity**: 1PB+ total storage capacity

### Content Classification and Caching Strategy

**Static Content (Images, CSS, JS)**
- **Caching Strategy**: Aggressive caching with long TTL
- **TTL**: 30 days to 1 year
- **Invalidation**: Manual or version-based
- **Storage**: Edge and regional caching

**Dynamic Content (API Responses, User Data)**
- **Caching Strategy**: Moderate caching with short TTL
- **TTL**: 1-60 minutes
- **Invalidation**: Time-based or event-driven
- **Storage**: Regional and origin caching

**Streaming Content (Video, Audio)**
- **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching with adaptive TTL
- **TTL**: 1-24 hours based on popularity
- **Invalidation**: Popularity-based eviction
- **Storage**: Edge caching for popular content

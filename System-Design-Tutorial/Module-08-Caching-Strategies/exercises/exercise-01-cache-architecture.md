## Sample Solution Framework

### Architecture Design

```
Client Browser
├── CDN Cache (CloudFront) - Static content, images
├── API Gateway Cache - API responses
└── Application Server
    ├── L1 Cache (Redis) - Hot data, sessions
    ├── L2 Cache (ElastiCache) - Product data, search results
    └── Database
        ├── Read Replicas - Query caching
        └── Master - Data updates
```

### Cache Placement Strategy

| Data Type | L1 Cache | L2 Cache | L3 Cache | L4 Cache | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Product Details** | Hot products | All products | Database | CDN | Hot data in L1, all in L2, static in CDN |
| **User Sessions** | Active sessions | All sessions | Database | - | Session data needs fast access |
| **Shopping Carts** | Active carts | All carts | Database | - | Real-time updates require fast access |
| **Search Results** | Popular queries | All queries | Search index | CDN | Query results can be cached longer |

### Invalidation Strategy

| Data Type | Invalidation Trigger | Method | TTL | Consistency |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|-----|-------------|
| **Product Details** | Price/description change | Event-based | 5 minutes | Eventual |
| **User Sessions** | User activity | Time-based | 30 minutes | Strong |
| **Shopping Carts** | Cart modification | Event-based | 1 hour | Strong |
| **Search Results** | Product updates | Time-based | 10 minutes | Eventual |

### Technology Selection Matrix

| Technology | Performance | Features | Scalability | Cost | Best For |
|------------|-------------|----------|-------------|------|----------|
| **Redis** | High | Rich | Excellent | Medium | L2 Cache, Complex data |
| **Memcached** | Very High | Simple | Good | Low | L1 Cache, Simple data |
| **Hazelcast** | High | Rich | Excellent | High | Distributed caching |
| **CloudFront** | Very High | CDN | Excellent | Medium | L3 Cache, Static content |

## Key Concepts to Consider

### Cache Hierarchy Principles
- **L1 Cache**: Fastest access, limited capacity, application-level
- **L2 Cache**: Distributed, shared across instances, medium capacity
- **L3 Cache**: CDN, global distribution, large capacity
- **L4 Cache**: Database-level, persistent, unlimited capacity

### Invalidation Strategies
- **Time-based**: TTL expiration, simple but may serve stale data
- **Event-based**: Real-time invalidation, complex but always fresh
- **Manual**: Administrative control, flexible but requires management
- **Hybrid**: Combination of strategies for different data types

### Consistency Models
- **Strong Consistency**: All reads return the most recent write
- **Eventual Consistency**: System will become consistent over time
- **Session Consistency**: Consistency within a user session
- **Causal Consistency**: Causally related operations are consistent

### Performance Factors
- **Hit Ratio**: Percentage of requests served from cache
- **Latency**: Time to retrieve data from cache
- **Throughput**: Number of requests processed per second
- **Memory Usage**: Amount of memory consumed by cache

### Design Patterns
- **Cache-Aside**: Application manages cache
- **Write-Through**: Write to cache and database simultaneously
- **Write-Behind**: Write to cache, update database asynchronously
- **Refresh-Ahead**: Proactively refresh cache before expiration

# Exercise 8 Solution: Cache Eviction Policies

## Overview

This solution provides a comprehensive approach to designing and implementing cache eviction policies for a multi-tenant SaaS platform with diverse data access patterns.

## Solution Framework

### 1. Eviction Policy Analysis

#### **Data Access Pattern Analysis**

**Temporal Patterns:**
- **Recent Access**: Data accessed recently is more likely to be accessed again
- **Frequency Patterns**: Data accessed frequently should be retained longer
- **Time-based Patterns**: Data access varies by time of day, day of week, season
- **User Behavior Patterns**: Different users have different access patterns

**Spatial Patterns:**
- **Geographic Patterns**: Data access varies by geographic location
- **Tenant Patterns**: Different tenants have different data access patterns
- **Service Patterns**: Different services access different data types
- **Resource Patterns**: Different resources have different access patterns

**Value-based Patterns:**
- **Business Value**: High-value data should be retained longer
- **Computational Cost**: Expensive-to-compute data should be retained longer
- **Storage Cost**: High-storage-cost data should be evicted more aggressively
- **Network Cost**: High-network-cost data should be retained longer

#### **Eviction Policy Selection Matrix**

| Data Type | Access Pattern | Business Value | Eviction Policy | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **User Sessions** | Recent, Frequent | High | LRU + TTL | Recent and frequent access |
| **Product Catalog** | Frequent, Stable | High | LFU + TTL | Frequent access, stable data |
| **Search Results** | Recent, Variable | Medium | LRU | Recent access, variable frequency |
| **Analytics Data** | Time-based | Low | Time-based | Time-based access patterns |
| **Configuration Data** | Infrequent, Stable | High | Manual | Infrequent but critical access |
| **Cache Metadata** | Frequent, Small | Low | FIFO | Frequent but low-value access |

### 2. Multi-tier Eviction Strategy

#### **L1 Cache Eviction (Application Memory)**

**Policy: LRU with TTL**
- **Rationale**: Recent access is the best predictor of future access
- **Implementation**: Use doubly-linked list with hash map for O(1) operations
- **TTL Integration**: Combine LRU with TTL for time-based eviction
- **Size Limit**: 1GB memory limit with 80% utilization threshold

**Eviction Triggers:**
- **Memory Pressure**: Evict when memory usage exceeds 80%
- **TTL Expiration**: Evict when TTL expires
- **Manual Eviction**: Evict on manual cache clear operations
- **Policy Change**: Evict when eviction policy changes

#### **L2 Cache Eviction (Distributed Cache)**

**Policy: LFU with LRU Fallback**
- **Rationale**: Frequency is a good predictor for distributed cache
- **Implementation**: Use frequency counters with LRU for tie-breaking
- **Adaptive TTL**: Adjust TTL based on access frequency
- **Size Limit**: 10GB per node with 85% utilization threshold

**Eviction Triggers:**
- **Memory Pressure**: Evict when memory usage exceeds 85%
- **Frequency Decay**: Evict when frequency drops below threshold
- **TTL Expiration**: Evict when TTL expires
- **Node Failure**: Evict when node fails or becomes unavailable

#### **L3 Cache Eviction (CDN)**

**Policy: Time-based with Popularity**
- **Rationale**: CDN caches benefit from time-based and popularity-based eviction
- **Implementation**: Combine TTL with popularity scoring
- **Geographic Variation**: Different TTL for different geographic regions
- **Size Limit**: 100GB per edge location with 90% utilization threshold

**Eviction Triggers:**
- **TTL Expiration**: Evict when TTL expires
- **Popularity Decay**: Evict when popularity drops below threshold
- **Storage Pressure**: Evict when storage usage exceeds 90%
- **Geographic Changes**: Evict when geographic patterns change

### 3. Adaptive Eviction Policies

# ADR-001: Cache Pattern Selection Strategy

## Status
ðŸ”„ Accepted

## Context
We need to implement a comprehensive caching strategy for our distributed system to improve performance and reduce database load. The system handles high-volume read operations with occasional writes, and we need to balance performance, consistency, and complexity.

### Current Situation
- Database queries are becoming a bottleneck
- Response times are exceeding SLA requirements
- System needs to handle 10x current load
- Data consistency requirements vary by data type
- Team has limited caching experience

### Constraints
- Must maintain data consistency for financial data
- Performance requirements: < 100ms response time
- Availability requirements: 99.9% uptime
- Budget constraints limit technology choices
- Team needs to implement solution within 3 months

## Decision
Use **Cache-Aside pattern** as the primary caching strategy for the system.

### Specific Implementation
- **Primary Pattern**: Cache-Aside for all read operations
- **Write Strategy**: Write-Through for critical data, Write-Behind for non-critical data
- **Cache Hierarchy**: 3-level hierarchy (Application, Distributed, CDN)
- **Consistency Model**: Eventual consistency for most data, strong consistency for financial data

## Rationale

### Why Cache-Aside?
1. **Full Control**: Provides complete control over cache behavior
2. **Flexibility**: Allows custom cache logic per use case
3. **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement
4. **Debugging**: Clear separation between cache and database operations
5. **Performance**: Can optimize for specific access patterns

### Why Not Other Patterns?
- **Read-Through**: Less control over cache behavior, harder to customize
- **Write-Through Only**: Too slow for high-volume writes
- **Write-Behind Only**: Risk of data loss, eventual consistency issues

### Evaluation Criteria
| Criteria | Weight | Cache-Aside | Read-Through | Write-Through | Write-Behind |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Performance | 30% | 8 | 7 | 6 | 9 |
| Control | 25% | 9 | 6 | 7 | 6 |
| Consistency | 20% | 7 | 7 | 9 | 5 |
| Complexity | 15% | 7 | 8 | 6 | 5 |
| Reliability | 10% | 8 | 8 | 8 | 6 |
| **Total Score** | **100%** | **7.8** | **7.0** | **7.2** | **6.8** |

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Read-Through Pattern
**Why Not Chosen**: 
- Less control over cache behavior
- Harder to implement custom logic
- More complex error handling
- Limited flexibility for different data types

### 2. Write-Through Only
**Why Not Chosen**:
- Too slow for high-volume writes
- Performance impact on write operations
- Not suitable for our use case

### 3. Write-Behind Only
**Why Not Chosen**:
- Risk of data loss
- Eventual consistency issues
- Complex error handling
- Not suitable for financial data

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Performance**: Significant improvement in read performance
- **Control**: Full control over cache behavior and policies
- **Flexibility**: Can implement custom logic per data type
- **Debugging**: Easy to debug cache-related issues
- **Scalability**: Can scale cache independently
- **Cost**: Reduced database load and costs

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Application code becomes more complex
- **Race Conditions**: Potential for race conditions in concurrent environments
- **Cache Stampede**: Risk of cache stampede on cache misses
- **Manual Management**: Requires careful cache key management
- **Error Handling**: Must handle both cache and database failures

### Risks
- **Cache Stampede**: Multiple requests for same data causing database overload
- **Stale Data**: Data becoming outdated in cache
- **Race Conditions**: Concurrent access causing data inconsistency
- **Memory Leaks**: Cache growing without bounds
- **Performance Degradation**: Poor cache hit ratio

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Cache Warming**: Proactive cache population to prevent stampedes
- **TTL Management**: Appropriate TTL values to prevent stale data
- **Locking**: Distributed locking to prevent race conditions
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring to detect issues
- **Circuit Breakers**: Fallback mechanisms for cache failures

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Cache-Aside Implementation
```python
class CacheAsideService:
    def __init__(self, cache_client, database_client):
        self.cache = cache_client
        self.db = database_client
        self.default_ttl = 3600
    
    def get_user(self, user_id):
        cache_key = f"user:{user_id}"
        cached_user = self.cache.get(cache_key)
        
        if cached_user:
            return json.loads(cached_user)
        
        user_data = self.db.get_user(user_id)
        if user_data:
            self.cache.setex(cache_key, self.default_ttl, json.dumps(user_data))
        
        return user_data
```

### Error Handling Implementation
```python
class RobustCacheAsideService:
    def __init__(self, cache_client, database_client, logger):
        self.cache = cache_client
        self.db = database_client
        self.logger = logger
        self.max_retries = 3
    
    def get_user_with_retry(self, user_id):
        cache_key = f"user:{user_id}"
        
        # Try cache with retry
        for attempt in range(self.max_retries):
            try:
                cached_user = self.cache.get(cache_key)
                if cached_user:
                    return json.loads(cached_user)
                break
            except Exception as e:
                self.logger.warning(f"Cache read attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}")
                if attempt == self.max_retries - 1:
                    break
                time.sleep(0.1 * (2 ** attempt))
        
        # Fall back to database
        try:
            user_data = self.db.get_user(user_id)
            if user_data:
                self._update_cache_with_retry(cache_key, user_data)
            return user_data
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Database read failed: {e}")
            raise
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting & Support

### Common Issues Resolution Guide
```bash
# Issue: Kafka consumer lag
Solution: Optimize partition count and consumer group configuration
Command: kafka-consumer-groups.sh --describe --group mygroup

# Issue: Event ordering problems
Solution: Use proper partitioning strategy and sequence numbers
Example: partition_key = f"order_{order_id}"

# Issue: Message delivery failures
Solution: Implement retry with exponential backoff and DLQ
Pattern: retry_delay = base_delay * (2 ** attempt_count)

# Issue: Schema evolution conflicts
Solution: Use backward-compatible changes and schema registry
Tool: AWS Glue Schema Registry with compatibility checking
```

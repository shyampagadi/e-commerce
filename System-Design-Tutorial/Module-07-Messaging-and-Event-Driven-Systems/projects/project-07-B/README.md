### Event Sourcing Flow
1. **Command Processing** → Validate business rules and generate events
2. **Event Persistence** → Store events in immutable event store
3. **Event Publishing** → Publish events to downstream processors
4. **Read Model Updates** → Update materialized views asynchronously
5. **Query Processing** → Serve queries from optimized read models
6. **Event Replay** → Rebuild state from historical events

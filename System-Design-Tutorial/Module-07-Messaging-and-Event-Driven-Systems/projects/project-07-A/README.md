- **Inventory Management**: Real-time inventory updates and reservation system
- **Payment Processing**: Secure payment workflow with retry mechanisms
- **Notification System**: Multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, push)
- **Analytics**: Real-time dashboards for business metrics

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Throughput**: 200+ orders per second sustained, 500+ peak
- **Latency**: Order confirmation within 500ms (P95)
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime (8.76 hours downtime/year)
- **Consistency**: Strong consistency for inventory, eventual for analytics
- **Scalability**: Auto-scale from 10 to 100 processing instances

### Event Flow Design
1. **Order Placement** → Order Service validates and publishes OrderCreated event
2. **Inventory Check** → Inventory Service reserves items, publishes InventoryReserved
3. **Payment Processing** → Payment Service processes payment, publishes PaymentCompleted
4. **Order Fulfillment** → Fulfillment Service creates shipment, publishes OrderShipped
5. **Notifications** → Notification Service sends updates via multiple channels
6. **Analytics** → Real-time metrics aggregation and dashboard updates

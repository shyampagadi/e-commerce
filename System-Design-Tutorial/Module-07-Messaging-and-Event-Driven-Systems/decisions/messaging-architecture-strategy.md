# ADR-001: Messaging Architecture Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to establish a comprehensive messaging architecture strategy for our distributed e-commerce platform. The system must handle various communication patterns including:

- Order processing workflows
- Real-time inventory updates
- Customer notifications
- Payment processing events
- Analytics and reporting data flows
- Integration with external partners

Key requirements:
- High throughput (10,000+ messages/second peak)
- Low latency for critical operations (<100ms)
- Guaranteed delivery for financial transactions
- Scalability to handle seasonal traffic spikes
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous patterns
- Event sourcing capabilities for audit trails

## Decision
We will implement a hybrid messaging architecture using multiple AWS services:

### Primary Architecture Components

1. **Amazon EventBridge** - Central event bus for application integration
2. **Amazon SQS** - Reliable message queuing for asynchronous processing
3. **Amazon SNS** - Pub/sub notifications and fan-out patterns
4. **Amazon MSK** - High-throughput event streaming for analytics
5. **Amazon MQ** - Enterprise messaging for legacy system integration

### Service Selection Matrix

| Use Case | Primary Service | Secondary Service | Rationale |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Order Processing | SQS FIFO | EventBridge | Guaranteed ordering, reliable delivery |
| Inventory Updates | EventBridge | SNS | Real-time routing, multiple subscribers |
| Customer Notifications | SNS | SQS | Fan-out to multiple channels |
| Payment Events | SQS FIFO | EventBridge | Financial accuracy, audit trail |
| Analytics Streaming | MSK | EventBridge | High throughput, real-time processing |
| Legacy Integration | Amazon MQ | SQS | Protocol compatibility |

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Messaging Infrastructure
```yaml
Services:
  - EventBridge Custom Bus (ecommerce-events)
  - SQS Queues (Standard and FIFO)
  - SNS Topics with filtering
  - Dead Letter Queues for error handling

Timeline: 4 weeks
Priority: High
```

### Phase 2: Event Streaming Platform
```yaml
Services:
  - MSK Cluster for analytics
  - Kinesis Data Streams for real-time processing
  - EventBridge Archive for replay capability

Timeline: 6 weeks
Priority: Medium
```

### Phase 3: Enterprise Integration
```yaml
Services:
  - Amazon MQ for legacy systems
  - Cross-region replication
  - Advanced monitoring and alerting

Timeline: 4 weeks
Priority: Low
```

## Architecture Patterns

### Event-Driven Microservices
```python
# Example: Order processing flow
class OrderEventFlow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.eventbridge = EventBridgeClient('ecommerce-events')
        self.sqs = SQSClient()
    
    def process_order_placed(self, order_data):
        # Publish to EventBridge for routing
        self.eventbridge.put_event(
            source='ecommerce.orders',
            detail_type='Order Placed',
            detail=order_data
        )
        
        # Send to FIFO queue for sequential processing
        self.sqs.send_message(
            queue_url='order-processing.fifo',
            message_body=order_data,
            message_group_id=f"customer_{order_data['customer_id']}"
        )
```

### Saga Pattern Implementation
```python
# Distributed transaction coordination
class OrderSaga:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state_machine = StepFunctions()
        self.eventbridge = EventBridgeClient()
    
    def start_order_saga(self, order_id):
        # Coordinate across multiple services
        saga_definition = {
            'payment_processing': PaymentService,
            'inventory_reservation': InventoryService,
            'shipping_arrangement': ShippingService,
            'notification_sending': NotificationService
        }
        
        return self.state_machine.start_execution(
            state_machine_arn='order-saga-sm',
            input={'orderId': order_id, 'saga': saga_definition}
        )
```

## Message Design Standards

### Event Schema Structure
```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid-v4",
  "eventType": "OrderPlaced",
  "eventVersion": "1.0",
  "source": "ecommerce.orders",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "correlationId": "correlation-uuid",
  "causationId": "command-uuid",
  "data": {
    "orderId": "order-123",
    "customerId": "customer-456",
    "items": [...],
    "totalAmount": 299.99,
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "userId": "user-789",
    "sessionId": "session-abc",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1"
  }
}
```

### Message Routing Strategy
```yaml
Routing Rules:
  High Priority Events:
    - Payment failures
    - Fraud alerts
    - System errors
    Route: Direct SQS → Immediate processing
  
  Business Events:
    - Order placed/cancelled
    - Inventory changes
    - Customer updates
    Route: EventBridge → Multiple subscribers
  
  Analytics Events:
    - User behavior
    - Performance metrics
    - Business intelligence
    Route: MSK → Stream processing
```

## Performance Targets

### Throughput Requirements
- **EventBridge**: 10,000 events/second
- **SQS Standard**: 3,000 messages/second per queue
- **SQS FIFO**: 300 messages/second per queue

# ADR-001: Messaging Architecture Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to establish a comprehensive messaging architecture strategy for our distributed e-commerce platform. The system must handle various communication patterns including:

- Order processing workflows
- Real-time inventory updates
- Customer notifications
- Payment processing events
- Analytics and reporting data flows
- Integration with external partners

Key requirements:
- High throughput (10,000+ messages/second peak)
- Low latency for critical operations (<100ms)
- Guaranteed delivery for financial transactions
- Scalability to handle seasonal traffic spikes
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous patterns
- Event sourcing capabilities for audit trails

## Decision
We will implement a hybrid messaging architecture using multiple AWS services:

### Primary Architecture Components

1. **Amazon EventBridge** - Central event bus for application integration
2. **Amazon SQS** - Reliable message queuing for asynchronous processing
3. **Amazon SNS** - Pub/sub notifications and fan-out patterns
4. **Amazon MSK** - High-throughput event streaming for analytics
5. **Amazon MQ** - Enterprise messaging for legacy system integration

### Service Selection Matrix

| Use Case | Primary Service | Secondary Service | Rationale |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Order Processing | SQS FIFO | EventBridge | Guaranteed ordering, reliable delivery |
| Inventory Updates | EventBridge | SNS | Real-time routing, multiple subscribers |
| Customer Notifications | SNS | SQS | Fan-out to multiple channels |
| Payment Events | SQS FIFO | EventBridge | Financial accuracy, audit trail |
| Analytics Streaming | MSK | EventBridge | High throughput, real-time processing |
| Legacy Integration | Amazon MQ | SQS | Protocol compatibility |

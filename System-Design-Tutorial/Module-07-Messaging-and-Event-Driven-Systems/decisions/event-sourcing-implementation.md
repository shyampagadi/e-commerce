# ADR-002: Event Sourcing Implementation Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to implement event sourcing for critical business domains that require:
- Complete audit trails for compliance and debugging
- Temporal queries to understand system state at any point in time
- Complex business workflows with multiple state transitions
- High availability and disaster recovery capabilities
- Integration with existing systems and future scalability

### Current Challenges
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring consistency across distributed services
- **Audit Requirements**: Regulatory compliance requiring complete transaction history
- **Complex Workflows**: Order processing, payment flows, and inventory management
- **Debugging Complexity**: Difficulty tracing issues in distributed systems
- **Scalability**: Need to scale read and write operations independently

### Business Requirements
- **Financial Transactions**: Complete audit trail for all monetary operations
- **Order Processing**: Track all state changes in order lifecycle
- **Inventory Management**: Maintain accurate inventory with full history
- **Customer Support**: Ability to reconstruct customer interaction history
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet SOX, PCI DSS, and GDPR requirements

## Decision
We will implement event sourcing using a hybrid approach that combines:

1. **Event Store**: DynamoDB-based event store for persistence
2. **CQRS**: Separate read and write models for optimal performance
3. **Event Bus**: EventBridge for event distribution and integration
4. **Snapshots**: Periodic snapshots for performance optimization
5. **Schema Evolution**: Versioned events with upgrade strategies

## Implementation Architecture

### Event Store Design Strategy

**Storage Architecture**
- **Primary Key**: Aggregate ID + Version for event ordering

### Aggregate Design Patterns

**Event Sourcing Principles**
- **Immutable Events**: Events are never modified once stored
- **Event Application**: State changes through event application
- **Event Raising**: Business logic raises domain events
- **History Replay**: Aggregate state rebuilt from event history

**Aggregate Lifecycle**
- **Creation**: Aggregate created with initial events
- **Modification**: State changes through event application
- **Persistence**: Events stored in event store
- **Reconstruction**: Aggregate rebuilt from event history

### Command and Query Separation

**Command Side Architecture**
- **Command Handlers**: Process business commands
- **Aggregate Loading**: Load aggregates from event store
- **Business Logic**: Execute domain logic and raise events
- **Event Persistence**: Store events in event store

**Query Side Architecture**
- **Read Models**: Optimized for query performance
- **Projections**: Transform events into read models
- **Eventual Consistency**: Acceptable for read operations
- **Query Optimization**: Denormalized data for fast queries

## Domain Implementation Strategy

## Event Schema Evolution

### Versioning Strategy

**Event Versioning Approach**
- **Version Tracking**: Track current version for each event type
- **Upgrader Functions**: Implement upgraders for version transitions
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with older versions
- **Migration Strategy**: Gradual migration of event schemas

**Schema Evolution Patterns**

- **Migration Testing**: Comprehensive testing of schema changes

### Upgrade Implementation

**Upgrader Design**
- **Version Mapping**: Map event types to current versions
- **Upgrader Registry**: Registry of upgrader functions
- **Sequential Upgrades**: Apply upgrades in sequence
- **Error Handling**: Handle upgrade failures gracefully

**Upgrade Examples**
- **Currency Addition**: Add currency field to order events
- **Tax Information**: Add tax fields to order events
- **Payment Details**: Enhance payment event structure
- **Customer Data**: Extend customer information in events

## Snapshot Implementation

### Snapshot Strategy

**Snapshot Purpose**
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduce event replay time for large aggregates
- **Storage Efficiency**: Compress aggregate state for storage
- **Recovery Speed**: Faster aggregate reconstruction
- **Resource Management**: Reduce memory and processing requirements

**Snapshot Design**

# ADR-007: Message Ordering Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to implement message ordering guarantees for our event-driven microservices architecture to ensure data consistency and correctness across distributed systems.

## Decision
We will implement a hybrid message ordering strategy that combines partition-based ordering for scalability with sequence-based ordering for critical operations.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: No Ordering
- **Pros**: Highest throughput, simplest implementation
- **Cons**: No consistency guarantees, potential data corruption
- **Use Case**: Independent operations, stateless processing

### Option 2: Total Ordering
- **Pros**: Strong consistency guarantees, global ordering
- **Cons**: Lower throughput, higher latency, complex implementation
- **Use Case**: Critical operations requiring strict ordering

### Option 3: Partition-Based Ordering (Selected)
- **Pros**: Balanced performance and consistency, scalable
- **Cons**: Ordering limited to partitions
- **Use Case**: User-specific operations, partition-based processing

### Option 4: Sequence-Based Ordering
- **Pros**: Simple implementation, good performance
- **Cons**: Requires coordination for uniqueness
- **Use Case**: Operations requiring sequence numbers

## Implementation Strategy

### Partition-Based Ordering
- Use consistent partition keys for related operations
- Implement partition assignment algorithms
- Handle partition rebalancing and scaling
- Monitor partition performance and load

### Sequence-Based Ordering
- Assign sequence numbers to critical operations
- Use high-resolution timestamps for temporal ordering
- Implement sequence number coordination
- Handle sequence number conflicts and gaps

### Hybrid Approach
- Use partition-based ordering for scalable operations
- Use sequence-based ordering for critical operations
- Implement ordering validation and conflict resolution
- Monitor ordering performance and accuracy

## Consequences

### Positive
- Balanced performance and consistency
- Scalable ordering implementation
- Flexible ordering strategies
- Good performance characteristics

### Negative
- Increased implementation complexity
- Additional monitoring requirements
- Potential ordering conflicts
- Higher resource usage

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics
- Ordering latency and throughput
- Ordering accuracy and correctness
- Partition performance and load
- Sequence number conflicts and gaps

### Alerting
- Ordering latency thresholds
- Ordering accuracy violations
- Partition performance issues
- Sequence number conflicts

## Review and Maintenance

### Review Schedule
- Monthly performance review
- Quarterly architecture review
- Annual strategy review

### Maintenance Tasks
- Monitor ordering performance
- Optimize ordering algorithms
- Update ordering strategies
- Handle ordering conflicts

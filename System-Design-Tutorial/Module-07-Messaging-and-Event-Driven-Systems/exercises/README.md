## Exercise Philosophy

### Concept-Focused Approach
Our exercises emphasize **architectural thinking** over coding:
- **Strategic Design**: Focus on high-level architecture decisions
- **Trade-off Analysis**: Evaluate different approaches and their implications
- **Systems Thinking**: Understand component interactions and dependencies
- **Business Alignment**: Connect technical decisions to business requirements

### Minimal Code Philosophy
Code is included only when essential for understanding:
- **Configuration Examples**: Show key settings and parameters
- **Architecture Snippets**: Illustrate design patterns and structures
- **Decision Frameworks**: Demonstrate evaluation criteria and selection logic
- **No Implementation Details**: Focus on design rather than coding

### Real-World Scenarios
All exercises use realistic business scenarios:
- **GlobalPay**: Financial payment processing (Exercise 05)
- **GlobalConnect**: Social media platform (Exercise 06)
- **E-commerce Platforms**: Order processing and inventory (Exercises 01-02)
- **IoT Analytics**: High-throughput data processing (Exercise 03)
- **Financial Trading**: Event sourcing and audit trails (Exercise 04)

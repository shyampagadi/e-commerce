# Exercise 05 Solution: Resilience Design Patterns for Messaging Systems

## Solution Overview
This solution demonstrates a comprehensive resilience strategy for GlobalPay's payment processing network, achieving 99.99% availability through systematic failure analysis, strategic circuit breaker placement, and operational excellence.

## Task 1 Solution: Failure Mode Analysis

### 1.1 Failure Scenario Analysis

#### Payment Provider APIs
| Failure Type | Frequency | Impact Radius | Recovery Time | Business Impact |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Complete Outage** | 2-3 times/year | All transactions via provider | 2-4 hours | High - $2M/hour revenue loss |
| **Partial Degradation** | Weekly | 10-30% transaction failure | 30-60 minutes | Medium - $500K/hour |
| **Slow Response** | Daily | Increased latency | 5-15 minutes | Low - User experience impact |
| **Incorrect Response** | Monthly | Data integrity issues | 1-2 hours | Critical - Compliance risk |

#### Fraud Detection Service
| Failure Type | Frequency | Impact Radius | Recovery Time | Business Impact |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Service Overload** | 2-3 times/week | All transactions queued | 10-20 minutes | Medium - Transaction delays |
| **Model Degradation** | Monthly | Increased false positives | 2-4 hours | High - Customer friction |
| **Complete Failure** | Quarterly | No fraud detection | 1-2 hours | Critical - Fraud exposure |

#### Internal Databases
| Failure Type | Frequency | Impact Radius | Recovery Time | Business Impact |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Primary DB Failure** | 2-3 times/year | All write operations | 30-60 seconds | Critical - System halt |
| **Read Replica Lag** | Weekly | Stale data reads | 5-10 minutes | Low - Minor inconsistency |
| **Connection Pool Exhaustion** | Monthly | New connections blocked | 2-5 minutes | Medium - Service degradation |

### 1.2 Failure Impact Matrix

```
High Impact    │ [DB Primary]     │ [Provider Outage] │ [Fraud Complete] │
               │                  │ [Model Degrade]   │                  │
Medium Impact  │ [Read Lag]       │ [Provider Partial]│ [Fraud Overload] │
               │ [Connection Pool]│                   │                  │
Low Impact     │                  │ [Slow Response]   │                  │
               └──────────────────┼───────────────────┼──────────────────┘
                Low Probability    Medium Probability   High Probability
```

**Priority Mitigation Order:**
1. **Critical/High Probability**: Fraud service overload, Provider partial failures
2. **Critical/Medium Probability**: Provider complete outage, Model degradation
3. **Critical/Low Probability**: Database primary failure, Complete fraud failure

## Task 2 Solution: Circuit Breaker Strategy Design

### 2.1 Circuit Breaker Placement Strategy

#### Payment Provider Circuit Breakers
```
Configuration for External Payment APIs:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Payment Provider Circuit Breaker                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Failure Threshold: 5 failures in 60 seconds            │
│ Recovery Timeout: 30 seconds                           │
│ Success Threshold: 3 consecutive successes             │
│ Timeout: 5 seconds per request                         │
│ Fallback: Route to secondary provider                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rationale**: External APIs are unreliable and expensive to call. Fast failure detection prevents cascade failures and enables quick provider switching.

#### Fraud Detection Circuit Breaker
```
Configuration for Fraud Detection Service:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Fraud Detection Circuit Breaker                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Failure Threshold: 10 failures in 30 seconds           │
│ Recovery Timeout: 60 seconds                           │
│ Success Threshold: 5 consecutive successes             │
│ Timeout: 2 seconds per request                         │
│ Fallback: Use cached risk scores + simple rules        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rationale**: Higher threshold due to internal service. Longer recovery time allows for auto-scaling. Fallback maintains security with reduced accuracy.

#### Database Circuit Breaker
```
Configuration for Database Connections:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Database Circuit Breaker                                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Failure Threshold: 3 failures in 10 seconds            │
│ Recovery Timeout: 10 seconds                           │
│ Success Threshold: 2 consecutive successes             │
│ Timeout: 500ms per query                               │
│ Fallback: Read from cache, queue writes                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rationale**: Database should be highly reliable. Low threshold for fast detection. Short recovery for quick failover to replicas.

### 2.2 Graceful Degradation Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Primary Payment Provider Down
**Detection**: Circuit breaker opens after 5 failures in 60 seconds
**Fallback Strategy**:
1. Immediately route to secondary provider (Visa → Mastercard)
2. If secondary also fails, route to tertiary provider
3. If all providers fail, queue transactions for retry
4. Notify users of slight delay but continue processing

**User Experience**: Transparent - user sees normal confirmation
**Business Impact**: <1% transaction failure rate, minimal revenue loss

#### Scenario B: Fraud Detection Service Overloaded
**Detection**: Response time >2 seconds or circuit breaker opens
**Fallback Strategy**:
1. Use cached risk scores for known customers
2. Apply simplified rule-based fraud detection
3. Flag high-risk transactions for manual review
4. Reduce fraud detection accuracy temporarily

**User Experience**: Some transactions require additional verification
**Business Impact**: 2-3x increase in fraud risk, but transactions continue

#### Scenario C: Database Primary Failure
**Detection**: Connection failures or query timeouts
**Fallback Strategy**:
1. Immediate failover to read replica promoted to primary
2. Queue write operations during failover window
3. Use cached data for read operations
4. Replay queued writes after recovery

**User Experience**: 30-60 second delay for write operations
**Business Impact**: No data loss, minimal service interruption

## Task 3 Solution: Bulkhead Pattern Implementation Strategy

### 3.1 Resource Isolation Design

#### Thread Pool Isolation Strategy
```
High-Priority Pool (Enterprise Customers):
├── Pool Size: 50 threads
├── Queue Size: 100 requests
├── Timeout: 10 seconds
└── Dedicated to transactions >$10,000

Standard Pool (Regular Customers):
├── Pool Size: 200 threads
├── Queue Size: 1000 requests
├── Timeout: 30 seconds
└── Handles 80% of transaction volume

Background Pool (Reporting/Analytics):
├── Pool Size: 20 threads
├── Queue Size: 500 requests
├── Timeout: 300 seconds
└── Non-critical operations only
```

#### Connection Pool Isolation
```
Payment Provider Connections:
├── Visa: 20 connections, 5 second timeout
├── Mastercard: 20 connections, 5 second timeout
├── PayPal: 15 connections, 8 second timeout
└── Each provider isolated to prevent cross-contamination

Database Connections:
├── Write Operations: 30 connections, 500ms timeout
├── Read Operations: 50 connections, 1 second timeout
├── Reporting Queries: 10 connections, 30 second timeout
└── Separate pools prevent reporting from blocking transactions
```

### 3.2 Failure Domain Boundaries

#### Geographic Boundaries
- **US East**: Primary processing region
- **US West**: Secondary processing region
- **EU**: European customer processing
- **APAC**: Asia-Pacific processing

Each region operates independently with local failover capabilities.

#### Service Type Boundaries
- **Payment Processing**: Core transaction handling
- **Fraud Detection**: Risk assessment and scoring
- **Reporting**: Analytics and compliance reporting
- **Customer Service**: Support and account management

#### Customer Tier Boundaries
- **Enterprise**: Dedicated resources, SLA guarantees
- **Business**: Shared resources, priority queuing
- **Consumer**: Standard resources, best effort

### 3.3 Resource Allocation Strategy

#### Normal Operations (70-30-10 Rule)
- 70% resources for standard transactions
- 20% resources for high-priority transactions
- 10% resources reserved for emergency capacity

#### Failure Scenarios
**Payment Provider Failure**: Reallocate 50% of failed provider's resources to remaining providers
**Fraud Service Overload**: Temporarily reduce fraud checking intensity, allocate more resources to transaction processing
**Database Issues**: Increase cache allocation, reduce non-essential query resources

## Task 4 Solution: Timeout and Retry Strategy

### 4.1 Timeout Configuration Matrix

| Service Type | Timeout (ms) | Justification | Fallback Action |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Payment Provider API** | 5000 | User waiting, provider SLA | Try next provider in sequence |
| **Fraud Detection** | 2000 | Real-time decision needed | Use cached score + simple rules |
| **Currency Conversion** | 1000 | Cached rates available | Use last known rate (max 1 hour old) |
| **Database Write** | 500 | Should be fast, affects UX | Retry once, then queue for later |
| **Database Read** | 1000 | User waiting for data | Serve from cache if available |
| **Regulatory Reporting** | 30000 | Batch operation, not time critical | Queue for retry during off-peak |

### 4.2 Retry Policy Design

#### Exponential Backoff Configuration
```
Initial Delay: 100ms
Maximum Attempts: 3
Backoff Multiplier: 2.0
Maximum Delay: 5000ms
Jitter: ±25% random variation

Retry Sequence:
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: 100ms ± 25ms
Attempt 3: 200ms ± 50ms
Attempt 4: 400ms ± 100ms (if max attempts = 4)
```

#### Service-Specific Retry Policies
**Payment Providers**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff, then try next provider
**Internal Services**: 2 attempts with linear backoff (100ms, 200ms)
**Database Operations**: 1 immediate retry, then circuit breaker

### 4.3 Dead Letter Queue Strategy

#### DLQ Configuration
```
Payment Transaction DLQ:
├── Retention: 7 days
├── Processing: Manual review within 4 hours
├── Alerting: Immediate for any message
└── Escalation: Manager notification after 1 hour

Fraud Detection DLQ:
├── Retention: 24 hours
├── Processing: Automated retry every 30 minutes
├── Alerting: Alert after 10 messages in queue
└── Escalation: Security team notification

Reporting DLQ:
├── Retention: 30 days
├── Processing: Automated retry during off-peak hours
├── Alerting: Daily summary report
└── Escalation: Weekly review meeting
```

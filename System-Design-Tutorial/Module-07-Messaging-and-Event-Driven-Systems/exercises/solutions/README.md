## Common Implementation Patterns

### Error Handling Pattern
```python
def process_with_retry(func, max_retries=3, backoff_factor=2):
    """Standard retry pattern used across solutions"""
    for attempt in range(max_retries + 1):
        try:
            return func()
        except TransientError as e:
            if attempt == max_retries:
                raise
            time.sleep(backoff_factor ** attempt)
```

### Event Publishing Pattern
```python
def publish_event_safely(event_data, event_bus, source):
    """Safe event publishing with error handling"""
    try:
        response = event_bus.put_events(
            Entries=[{
                'Source': source,
                'DetailType': event_data['type'],
                'Detail': json.dumps(event_data)
            }]
        )
        return response['FailedEntryCount'] == 0
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to publish event: {e}")
        return False
```

### Message Processing Pattern
```python
def process_messages_batch(queue_url, handler_func, batch_size=10):
    """Efficient batch message processing"""
    while True:
        messages = sqs.receive_message(
            QueueUrl=queue_url,
            MaxNumberOfMessages=batch_size,
            WaitTimeSeconds=20
        ).get('Messages', [])
        
        for message in messages:
            if handler_func(message):
                sqs.delete_message(
                    QueueUrl=queue_url,
                    ReceiptHandle=message['ReceiptHandle']
                )
```

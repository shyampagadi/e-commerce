#### Data Residency and Compliance Mapping

**Strictly Local Data (Cannot Leave Region)**:
- **EU**: All personal data under GDPR (profiles, messages, metadata)
- **China**: All user data under Cybersecurity Law
- **Russia**: Personal data of Russian citizens under Federal Law 242-FZ
- **Brazil**: Sensitive personal data under LGPD

**Regionally Replicated Data**:
- **User Profiles**: Replicated within compliance boundaries
- **Social Graph**: Friend connections within regional clusters
- **Content Preferences**: Localized recommendation data

**Globally Replicated Data**:
- **Public Content**: Posts marked as public with user consent
- **Trending Topics**: Aggregated, anonymized trend data
- **System Metadata**: Performance metrics, system health data

#### Infrastructure Considerations by Region

**North America (Primary Hub: US-East-1)**
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS (primary), Azure (secondary), GCP (tertiary)
- **Compliance**: CCPA (California), PIPEDA (Canada)
- **Network**: Excellent connectivity, multiple tier-1 providers
- **Disaster Recovery**: US-West-2 as secondary region

**Europe (Primary Hub: EU-West-1)**
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS (primary), Azure (secondary)
- **Compliance**: GDPR (strict), national data protection laws
- **Network**: Good connectivity, GDPR data residency requirements
- **Disaster Recovery**: EU-Central-1 as secondary region

**Asia-Pacific (Primary Hub: AP-South-1)**

- **Disaster Recovery**: AP-Southeast-1 as secondary region

### 1.2 Data Classification and Flow Design

#### Data Classification Framework
```
Classification Levels:
├── Level 1 - Strictly Local (No cross-border transfer)
│   ├── Personal identifiable information (PII)
│   ├── Private messages and communications
│   ├── Payment and financial information
│   └── Biometric and health data
│
├── Level 2 - Regionally Replicated (Within compliance zones)
│   ├── User profiles and preferences
│   ├── Social connections and relationships
│   ├── Content interaction history
│   └── Localized recommendation data
│
├── Level 3 - Globally Replicated (With consent/anonymization)
│   ├── Public posts and content
│   ├── Aggregated analytics data
│   ├── Trending topics and hashtags
│   └── System performance metrics
│
└── Level 4 - Metadata Only (Technical data)
    ├── System logs and audit trails
    ├── Performance monitoring data
    ├── Security event information
    └── Infrastructure metrics
```

#### Cross-Region Data Flow Rules

**User Migration Handling**:
1. **Temporary Travel**: Data stays in home region, access via secure tunnel
2. **Permanent Relocation**: Initiate data migration process with user consent
3. **Dual Residency**: Maintain data in both regions with synchronization

**Global Content Synchronization**:
1. **Public Posts**: Replicate globally with 5-second target latency
2. **Trending Content**: Aggregate regionally, sync summaries globally
3. **Viral Content**: Accelerated replication with content delivery network

**Compliance-Driven Restrictions**:
1. **EU Users**: No data transfer outside EU without explicit consent
2. **Chinese Users**: All data processing within China mainland
3. **Russian Users**: Personal data stored on Russian territory

### 1.3 Messaging Topology Design

#### Hybrid Topology Architecture
**Regional Hubs (Tier 1)**:
- Americas Hub (US-East-1): Serves North and South America
- Europe Hub (EU-West-1): Serves Europe, Middle East, Africa
- Asia-Pacific Hub (AP-South-1): Serves Asia-Pacific region

**Regional Nodes (Tier 2)**:
- Connected to regional hubs via dedicated high-bandwidth links
- Handle local traffic and provide disaster recovery
- Maintain regional data sovereignty

**Edge Locations (Tier 3)**:
- CDN and edge computing for static content
- Real-time messaging acceleration
- Local caching and content optimization

#### Message Routing Strategy
```
Routing Decision Tree:
├── Is destination user in same region?
│   ├── Yes → Direct regional routing
│   └── No → Check data classification
│       ├── Level 1 (Strictly Local) → Block transfer, notify user
│       ├── Level 2 (Regional) → Route via compliance gateway
│       ├── Level 3 (Global) → Direct hub-to-hub routing
│       └── Level 4 (Metadata) → Standard routing
│
├── Is user currently traveling?
│   ├── Yes → Route to home region via secure tunnel
│   └── No → Standard regional routing
│
└── Is this emergency communication?
    ├── Yes → Override restrictions with audit log
    └── No → Apply standard routing rules
```

## Task 2 Solution: Consistency Model Design

### 2.1 Consistency Requirements Analysis

#### Strong Consistency Requirements
**Financial Transactions**:
- Payment processing and billing
- Account balance updates
- Subscription status changes
- **Implementation**: Synchronous replication with 2PC protocol

**Authentication and Authorization**:
- User login and session management
- Permission and role changes
- Security policy updates
- **Implementation**: Global identity service with strong consistency

**Critical System Configuration**:
- Feature flags and system settings
- Security policies and rules
- Compliance configuration changes
- **Implementation**: Configuration service with consensus protocol

#### Eventual Consistency Acceptable
**Social Media Content**:
- Posts, comments, likes, shares
- User activity feeds and timelines
- Recommendation algorithms
- **Implementation**: Asynchronous replication with conflict resolution

**Analytics and Reporting**:
- User engagement metrics
- Content performance analytics
- System performance data
- **Implementation**: Eventually consistent with batch reconciliation

### 2.2 Conflict Resolution Strategy

#### User Profile Conflicts
**Scenario**: User updates profile from multiple devices simultaneously

**Resolution Strategy**: Last-Writer-Wins with Merge
```
Conflict Resolution Algorithm:
1. Compare timestamps of conflicting updates
2. Apply most recent update for each field
3. Merge non-conflicting fields automatically
4. Flag conflicts requiring user resolution
5. Notify user of merged changes

Example:
Device A (10:00): Updates name "John Smith" → "John S. Smith"
Device B (10:01): Updates location "New York" → "San Francisco"
Result: Name = "John S. Smith", Location = "San Francisco"
```

#### Social Interaction Conflicts
**Scenario**: Concurrent likes, comments, and shares on same post

**Resolution Strategy**: Additive CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type)
```
Social Interaction CRDT:
├── Likes: G-Counter (increment-only counter)
├── Comments: OR-Set (observed-remove set)
├── Shares: G-Counter with unique share IDs
└── Reactions: Multi-value register with timestamps

Conflict Resolution:
- Likes: Sum all increments from all regions
- Comments: Union of all comment sets, remove duplicates
- Shares: Count unique share IDs across all regions
- Reactions: Keep most recent reaction per user per post
```

#### Content Moderation Conflicts
**Scenario**: Content flagged for moderation in multiple regions simultaneously

**Resolution Strategy**: Strictest Policy Wins
```
Moderation Conflict Resolution:
1. Collect all moderation decisions across regions
2. Apply strictest policy (block > restrict > warn > allow)
3. Maintain audit trail of all decisions
4. Allow regional policy overrides for local compliance
5. Escalate conflicts to global moderation team

Priority Order:
1. Legal compliance requirements (highest)
2. Community safety policies
3. Regional cultural sensitivities
4. Platform community guidelines (lowest)
```

### 2.3 Consistency Monitoring and Validation

├── Replication Lag by Region Pair
│   ├── Americas ↔ Europe: Target <2s, Alert >5s
│   ├── Americas ↔ Asia-Pacific: Target <3s, Alert >8s

│   ├── Social interaction conflicts: <0.01% of interactions
│   └── Average resolution time: <500ms
│
├── Data Divergence Detection

│   ├── Automated reconciliation for <1% divergence
│   └── Manual review for >1% divergence
│
└── Convergence Time Measurement
    ├── Simple updates: <2 seconds globally
    ├── Complex updates: <10 seconds globally
    └── Conflict resolution: <30 seconds globally
```

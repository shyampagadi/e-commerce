## Key Concepts to Consider

### Security Architecture
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access
- **Separation of Duties**: Divide security responsibilities

### Encryption Strategies
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Same key for encryption/decryption
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Different keys for encryption/decryption
- **Key Management**: Secure key generation, storage, and rotation
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Forward secrecy for communications

### Access Control Models
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control
- **ABAC**: Attribute-based access control
- **DAC**: Discretionary access control
- **MAC**: Mandatory access control

### Compliance Frameworks
- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
- **SOC 2**: Service Organization Control 2
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation
- **PCI DSS**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard

## Additional Resources

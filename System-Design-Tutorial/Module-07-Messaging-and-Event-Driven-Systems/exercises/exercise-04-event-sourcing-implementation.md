## Key Concepts to Consider

### Event Sourcing Principles
- **Event Store**: Immutable log of all events
- **Aggregates**: Consistency boundaries for business logic
- **Commands**: Intent to change system state
- **Events**: Record of what happened

### CQRS Patterns
- **Command Side**: Optimized for writes and business logic
- **Query Side**: Optimized for reads and reporting
- **Event Projections**: Transform events into read models
- **Eventual Consistency**: Read models eventually consistent

### Schema Evolution
- **Backward Compatibility**: New code works with old events
- **Forward Compatibility**: Old code works with new events
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning for events
- **Migration**: Smooth transition between versions

### Performance Optimization
- **Event Batching**: Process multiple events together
- **Snapshot Optimization**: Reduce replay time with snapshots
- **Read Model Optimization**: Optimize query performance
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data

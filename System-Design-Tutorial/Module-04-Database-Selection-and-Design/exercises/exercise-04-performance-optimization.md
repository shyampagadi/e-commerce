# Exercise 04: Performance Optimization

## Overview
This exercise focuses on optimizing database performance through indexing, query optimization, and database tuning. You'll learn to identify performance bottlenecks and implement optimization strategies.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify database performance bottlenecks
- Design effective indexing strategies
- Optimize database queries
- Implement database tuning techniques
- Monitor and measure performance improvements

## Scenario
You are optimizing a multi-tenant e-commerce platform database that is experiencing performance issues:

**Current Performance Issues:**
- Slow query response times (5-10 seconds)
- High CPU usage (80-90%)
- Memory pressure and swapping
- Lock contention and blocking
- Poor scalability under load

**Database Statistics:**
- 50M+ users
- 100M+ products
- 1M+ orders per day
- 10K+ concurrent users
- 100GB+ database size

## Exercise Tasks

### Task 1: Performance Analysis
Analyze the current database performance and identify bottlenecks:

**Queries to Analyze:**
```sql
-- Slow query 1: User profile lookup
SELECT u.*, p.*, o.*
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.user_id
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE u.email = 'user@example.com'
AND o.created_at > '2024-01-01';

-- Slow query 2: Product search
SELECT p.*, c.name as category_name, r.rating
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.id = r.product_id
WHERE p.name LIKE '%laptop%'
AND p.price BETWEEN 500 AND 2000
AND p.status = 'active'
ORDER BY r.rating DESC, p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Slow query 3: Order analytics
SELECT 
    DATE(o.created_at) as order_date,
    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(o.total_amount) as avg_order_value
FROM orders o
WHERE o.created_at >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY DATE(o.created_at)
ORDER BY order_date DESC;
```

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze each query's execution plan
2. Identify performance bottlenecks
3. Calculate query cost and resource usage
4. Document findings and recommendations
5. Prioritize optimization opportunities

### Task 2: Indexing Strategy
Design and implement an indexing strategy to improve query performance:

**Index Requirements:**
- Improve query performance by 50%+
- Minimize index maintenance overhead
- Optimize for read-heavy workloads
- Consider storage space implications
- Plan for index monitoring and maintenance

**Instructions:**
1. Design indexes for the analyzed queries
2. Create index creation scripts
3. Calculate index storage requirements
4. Plan index maintenance strategy
5. Document index usage and monitoring

### Task 3: Query Optimization
Optimize the slow queries to improve performance:

**Optimization Techniques:**
- Rewrite queries for better performance
- Use appropriate JOIN strategies
- Optimize WHERE clauses and conditions
- Implement query hints and directives
- Consider materialized views

**Instructions:**
1. Rewrite each slow query
2. Test and measure performance improvements
3. Document optimization techniques used
4. Provide alternative query approaches
5. Validate query results and correctness

### Task 4: Database Tuning
Implement database-level tuning optimizations:

**Tuning Areas:**
- Memory configuration (buffer pool, query cache)
- Connection pooling and management
- Lock and transaction management
- Storage engine configuration
- Query optimizer settings

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze current database configuration
2. Identify tuning opportunities
3. Implement configuration changes
4. Test and validate improvements
5. Document tuning parameters and rationale

### Task 5: Performance Monitoring
Design and implement a performance monitoring system:

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- Real-time performance metrics
- Query performance tracking
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Alerting on performance thresholds
- Historical performance analysis

**Instructions:**
1. Design monitoring architecture
2. Implement performance metrics collection
3. Create dashboards and visualizations
4. Set up alerting and notifications
5. Plan for performance trend analysis

# Exercise 02: Database Selection

## Overview
This exercise focuses on selecting the appropriate database technology for different use cases in a multi-tenant e-commerce platform. You'll analyze requirements and make informed decisions about database selection.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand database selection criteria
- Apply selection criteria to real-world scenarios
- Make informed decisions about database technology
- Consider trade-offs between different database types

## Scenario
You are designing a multi-tenant e-commerce platform that needs to handle:
- 50M+ users globally
- 100M+ products with complex metadata
- 1M+ orders per day
- Real-time analytics and reporting
- Search functionality
- Session management
- Content management

## Exercise Tasks

### Task 1: Database Selection Matrix
Create a database selection matrix for the following data types:

| Data Type | Requirements | RDBMS | Document DB | Key-Value | Column-Family | Graph DB | Time-Series |
|-----------|-------------|-------|-------------|-----------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| User Profiles | Complex relationships, ACID compliance | | | | | | |
| Product Catalog | Flexible schema, search, metadata | | | | | | |
| Order Data | ACID compliance, transactions | | | | | | |
| Session Data | Fast access, temporary storage | | | | | | |
| Analytics Data | Time-series, aggregation | | | | | | |
| Search Index | Full-text search, faceted search | | | | | | |
| Content Management | Flexible schema, versioning | | | | | | |
| Recommendation Data | Graph relationships, real-time | | | | | | |

**Instructions:**
1. For each data type, analyze the requirements
2. Evaluate each database type against the requirements
3. Rate each option as: Excellent (5), Good (4), Fair (3), Poor (2), Not Suitable (1)
4. Provide justification for your ratings

### Task 2: Database Selection Decision Tree
Create a decision tree for database selection based on the following criteria:

**Primary Criteria:**
- Data Structure (Structured, Semi-structured, Unstructured)
- Consistency Requirements (Strong, Eventual, None)
- Scalability Needs (Vertical, Horizontal, Both)
- Query Patterns (Simple, Complex, Analytical)
- Performance Requirements (Latency, Throughput, Both)

**Instructions:**
1. Create a flowchart showing the decision process
2. Include decision points and criteria
3. Show the recommended database type for each path
4. Include fallback options and trade-offs

### Task 3: AWS Database Service Selection
Select the appropriate AWS database service for each use case:

| Use Case | AWS Service | Justification |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| User authentication and profiles | | |
| Product catalog with search | | |
| Order processing and payments | | |
| Real-time analytics | | |
| Session storage | | |
| Content management | | |
| Recommendation engine | | |
| Log analysis | | |

**Instructions:**
1. Consider AWS-specific features and capabilities
2. Evaluate cost implications
3. Consider integration with other AWS services
4. Provide detailed justification for each selection

### Task 4: Database Architecture Design
Design a database architecture for the e-commerce platform:

**Requirements:**
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Global distribution
- High availability (99.99%)
- Scalability to handle growth
- Data consistency across regions
- Backup and disaster recovery

**Instructions:**
1. Create a high-level architecture diagram
2. Show database placement and relationships
3. Include data flow and synchronization
4. Specify replication and backup strategies
5. Document trade-offs and decisions

### Task 5: Migration Strategy
Design a migration strategy from a monolithic database to the new architecture:

**Current State:**
- Single PostgreSQL database
- All data in one database
- Limited scalability
- Single point of failure

**Target State:**
- Polyglot persistence
- Multiple database types
- Global distribution
- High availability

**Instructions:**
1. Create a migration plan with phases
2. Identify migration challenges and risks
3. Design data synchronization strategy
4. Plan rollback procedures
5. Estimate timeline and resources

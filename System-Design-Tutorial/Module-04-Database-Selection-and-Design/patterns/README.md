# Database Design Patterns

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive database design patterns that demonstrate best practices for building scalable, maintainable, and performant database architectures. These patterns provide proven solutions to common database design challenges and can be adapted to various use cases.

## Pattern Categories

### 1. Data Modeling Patterns
- **Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) Pattern**: Flexible schema for dynamic attributes
- **Polymorphic Association Pattern**: Handling multiple entity types in relationships
- **Audit Trail Pattern**: Tracking changes to data over time
- **Soft Delete Pattern**: Marking records as deleted without physical removal
- **Versioning Pattern**: Maintaining multiple versions of data

### 2. Performance Patterns
- **Read Replica Pattern**: Distributing read load across multiple database instances
- **Write-Through Caching Pattern**: Synchronizing cache with database writes
- **Write-Behind Caching Pattern**: Asynchronous database writes from cache
- **Materialized View Pattern**: Pre-computed views for complex queries
- **Partitioning Pattern**: Dividing large tables into manageable pieces

### 3. Scalability Patterns
- **Sharding Pattern**: Horizontal partitioning across multiple databases
- **Federation Pattern**: Distributing data across multiple database systems
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separating read and write models
- **Event Sourcing Pattern**: Storing events instead of current state
- **Saga Pattern**: Managing distributed transactions

### 4. Consistency Patterns
- **Eventual Consistency Pattern**: Allowing temporary inconsistencies
- **Strong Consistency Pattern**: Ensuring immediate consistency
- **Causal Consistency Pattern**: Maintaining causal relationships
- **Session Consistency Pattern**: Consistency within user sessions
- **Monotonic Consistency Pattern**: Preventing data from going backwards

### 5. Integration Patterns
- **Database per Service Pattern**: Each service owns its database
- **Shared Database Pattern**: Multiple services share a database
- **API Composition Pattern**: Combining data from multiple sources
- **Data Synchronization Pattern**: Keeping data consistent across systems
- **Change Data Capture Pattern**: Capturing and propagating data changes

## Pattern Structure

Each pattern follows a consistent structure:

### 1. Pattern Overview
- **Name**: Clear, descriptive name
- **Intent**: What problem the pattern solves
- **Context**: When to use the pattern
- **Forces**: Trade-offs and considerations

### 2. Problem Statement
- **Description**: Detailed problem description
- **Symptoms**: How to identify the problem
- **Consequences**: What happens if not addressed
- **Examples**: Real-world scenarios

### 3. Solution
- **Structure**: How the pattern is organized
- **Participants**: Key components and their roles
- **Collaborations**: How components interact
- **Implementation**: Step-by-step implementation guide

### 4. Implementation Details
- **Code Examples**: Practical implementation examples
- **Configuration**: Required configuration settings
- **Dependencies**: External dependencies and requirements
- **Testing**: How to test the pattern

### 5. Consequences
- **Benefits**: Advantages of using the pattern
- **Liabilities**: Disadvantages and limitations
- **Trade-offs**: Key decisions and compromises
- **Alternatives**: Other patterns that could be used

### 6. Related Patterns
- **Similar Patterns**: Patterns that solve similar problems
- **Complementary Patterns**: Patterns that work well together
- **Conflicting Patterns**: Patterns that don't work well together
- **Evolution**: How patterns can evolve over time

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Pattern Selection
- **Understand Requirements**: Clearly define your requirements
- **Evaluate Trade-offs**: Consider the benefits and liabilities
- **Consider Context**: Ensure the pattern fits your environment
- **Plan for Evolution**: Choose patterns that can adapt

### 2. Implementation
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic implementation
- **Iterate and Refine**: Continuously improve the implementation
- **Monitor and Measure**: Track performance and effectiveness
- **Document Decisions**: Record why patterns were chosen

### 3. Maintenance
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review pattern effectiveness
- **Update as Needed**: Modify patterns as requirements change
- **Share Knowledge**: Document lessons learned
- **Train Team**: Ensure team understands the patterns

## Pattern Examples

### Example 1: Read Replica Pattern
```sql
-- Primary database
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Read replica configuration
-- Automatically replicates from primary
-- Handles read queries only
-- Provides high availability
```

### Example 2: Sharding Pattern
```python
# Shard routing logic
def get_shard_id(user_id):
    return user_id % NUM_SHARDS

def route_query(query, user_id):
    shard_id = get_shard_id(user_id)
    return shards[shard_id].execute(query)
```

### Example 3: CQRS Pattern
```python
# Command side (write)
class UserCommandHandler:
    def create_user(self, user_data):
        # Write to write database
        user = User.create(user_data)
        # Publish event
        event_bus.publish(UserCreatedEvent(user.id, user_data))

# Query side (read)
class UserQueryHandler:
    def get_user(self, user_id):
        # Read from read database
        return user_read_db.get_user(user_id)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Pattern Design
- **Keep It Simple**: Start with simple patterns
- **Make It Flexible**: Design for change and evolution
- **Document Everything**: Clear documentation is essential
- **Test Thoroughly**: Comprehensive testing is critical

### 2. Pattern Implementation
- **Follow Standards**: Use established patterns and conventions
- **Consider Performance**: Optimize for your specific use case
- **Plan for Scale**: Design patterns that can scale
- **Monitor Continuously**: Track pattern effectiveness

### 3. Pattern Maintenance
- **Regular Updates**: Keep patterns current and relevant
- **Version Control**: Track pattern changes over time
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Share patterns across teams
- **Continuous Learning**: Learn from pattern usage

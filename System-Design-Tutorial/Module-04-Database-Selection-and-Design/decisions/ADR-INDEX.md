# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) - Module 04

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Module-04: Database Selection and Design. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the design and implementation of database solutions.

## ADR Status Legend

- **Proposed**: Decision is under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Current ADRs for Module-04

### ADR-04-001: Database Technology Selection
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Use polyglot persistence strategy with multiple database technologies
- **Rationale**: Different use cases require different database strengths
- **File**: [database-technology-selection.md](./database-technology-selection.md)

### ADR-04-002: Data Consistency Model
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Implement eventual consistency for most use cases with strong consistency for critical operations
- **Rationale**: Balance between performance and data integrity requirements
- **File**: [data-consistency-model.md](./data-consistency-model.md)

### ADR-04-003: Database Sharding Strategy
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Use horizontal sharding with consistent hashing for distributed databases
- **Rationale**: Enables linear scalability and even data distribution
- **File**: [database-sharding-strategy.md](./database-sharding-strategy.md)

### ADR-04-004: Caching Architecture
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Implement multi-layer caching with Redis and CDN
- **Rationale**: Improves performance and reduces database load
- **File**: [caching-architecture.md](./caching-architecture.md)

### ADR-04-005: Data Migration Strategy
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Use blue-green deployment with data synchronization for database migrations
- **Rationale**: Minimizes downtime and reduces migration risk
- **File**: [data-migration-strategy.md](./data-migration-strategy.md)

## Guidelines for Creating ADRs

### When to Create an ADR
- Database technology choices that affect multiple components
- Data consistency decisions that impact system design
- Performance optimization strategies that affect scalability
- Security decisions that affect data protection
- Migration decisions that affect system evolution

### ADR Template
Use the following template for new ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-04-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded]

## Context
[Background and problem statement]

## Decision
[The architectural decision made]

## Rationale
[Why this decision was made]

## Consequences
[Positive and negative consequences]

## Alternatives Considered
[Other options that were considered]

## Implementation Notes
[How to implement this decision]

## Related ADRs

```

### Naming Convention
- Format: `ADR-04-XXX-descriptive-name.md`
- XXX: Three-digit number (001, 002, 003, etc.)
- Use kebab-case for descriptive name
- Examples:
  - `ADR-04-001-database-technology-selection.md`
  - `ADR-04-002-data-consistency-model.md`
  - `ADR-04-003-database-sharding-strategy.md`

## Review Process

### ADR Review Steps
1. **Draft**: Create ADR with proposed status
2. **Review**: Technical team reviews the ADR
3. **Discussion**: Address feedback and concerns
4. **Approval**: Change status to accepted
5. **Implementation**: Implement the decision
6. **Monitoring**: Monitor consequences and update if needed

### Review Criteria
- **Technical Soundness**: Is the decision technically correct?
- **Consistency**: Does it align with other architectural decisions?
- **Completeness**: Are all aspects of the decision covered?
- **Clarity**: Is the decision clearly documented?
- **Consequences**: Are the consequences well understood?

## Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
- **Monthly**: Review all proposed ADRs
- **Quarterly**: Review all accepted ADRs
- **Annually**: Review all ADRs for relevance

### Updates
- Update ADR status when decisions change
- Add implementation notes as decisions are implemented
- Document lessons learned and updates

### Deprecation
- Mark ADRs as deprecated when no longer relevant
- Mark ADRs as superseded when replaced by newer decisions
- Archive deprecated ADRs after 1 year

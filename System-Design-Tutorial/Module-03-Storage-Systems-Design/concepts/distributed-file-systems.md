# Distributed File Systems

## Overview
Distributed file systems provide a unified view of storage across multiple nodes, enabling scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability. They abstract the complexity of managing storage across distributed infrastructure while providing familiar file system semantics.

## Core Concepts

### Distributed Storage Fundamentals
- **Data Distribution**: Spreading data across multiple nodes
- **Replication**: Creating multiple copies for fault tolerance
- **Consistency**: Ensuring data coherence across replicas
- **Partitioning**: Dividing data into manageable chunks
- **Metadata Management**: Tracking file locations and attributes

### Key Characteristics
- **Transparency**: Users see a single file system
- **Scalability**: Add nodes to increase capacity/performance
- **Fault Tolerance**: Continue operation despite node failures
- **Consistency Models**: Various levels of data consistency
- **Performance**: Parallel access to distributed data

## Architecture Patterns

### Master-Slave Architecture
```
Master Node (Metadata Server)
├── Tracks file locations and metadata
├── Manages namespace operations
├── Coordinates replication
└── Handles client requests

Slave Nodes (Data Servers)
├── Store actual file data
├── Report status to master
├── Handle read/write operations
└── Participate in replication
```

**Examples**: Google File System (GFS), Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)

### Peer-to-Peer Architecture
```
All Nodes are Equal
├── Each node stores data and metadata
├── Distributed hash tables for location
├── No single point of failure
└── Self-organizing and healing
```

**Examples**: Ceph, GlusterFS

### Hybrid Architecture
```
Metadata Cluster + Data Nodes
├── Multiple metadata servers for HA
├── Separate data storage nodes
├── Load balancing across components
└── Specialized roles for optimization
```

**Examples**: Lustre, BeeGFS

## Consistency Models

### Strong Consistency
- **Linearizability**: Operations appear instantaneous
- **Sequential Consistency**: Operations appear in program order
- **Use Cases**: Financial systems, databases
- **Trade-offs**: Higher latency, lower availability

### Eventual Consistency
- **Convergence**: All replicas eventually consistent
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic or manual resolution
- **Use Cases**: Content distribution, social media
- **Trade-offs**: Lower latency, higher availability

### Weak Consistency
- **Best Effort**: No guarantees on consistency timing
- **Application Responsibility**: Handle inconsistencies
- **Use Cases**: Gaming, real-time collaboration
- **Trade-offs**: Highest performance, complex applications

## Replication Strategies

### Synchronous Replication
```
Write Operation Flow:
1. Client sends write request
2. Primary node receives write
3. Primary replicates to all replicas
4. All replicas acknowledge
5. Primary acknowledges to client
```

**Advantages**: Strong consistency, immediate durability
**Disadvantages**: Higher latency, reduced availability

### Asynchronous Replication
```
Write Operation Flow:
1. Client sends write request
2. Primary node receives write
3. Primary acknowledges to client
4. Primary replicates to replicas (background)
5. Replicas acknowledge (eventually)
```

**Advantages**: Lower latency, higher availability
**Disadvantages**: Potential data loss, eventual consistency

### Quorum-Based Replication
```
Quorum Requirements:
- Read Quorum (R): Minimum replicas for read
- Write Quorum (W): Minimum replicas for write
- Total Replicas (N): Total number of replicas
- Consistency: R + W > N
```

**Example**: N=3, W=2, R=2 ensures strong consistency

## Data Distribution Techniques

### Hash-Based Distribution
```python
def get_node(filename, num_nodes):
    hash_value = hash(filename)
    return hash_value % num_nodes
```

**Advantages**: Even distribution, simple implementation
**Disadvantages**: Difficult rebalancing, hotspots possible

### Range-Based Distribution
```python
def get_node(filename, ranges):
    for i, range_end in enumerate(ranges):
        if filename <= range_end:
            return i
    return len(ranges) - 1
```

**Advantages**: Range queries efficient, ordered data
**Disadvantages**: Uneven distribution, complex rebalancing

### Consistent Hashing
```python
def get_nodes(filename, ring, replication_factor):
    hash_value = hash(filename)
    nodes = []
    for i in range(replication_factor):
        node = ring.get_successor(hash_value + i)
        nodes.append(node)
    return nodes
```

**Advantages**: Minimal rebalancing, fault tolerance
**Disadvantages**: Complex implementation, potential imbalance

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies
- **Client-Side Caching**: Reduce network round trips
- **Metadata Caching**: Cache directory structures
- **Data Caching**: Cache frequently accessed blocks
- **Write-Back Caching**: Batch writes for efficiency

### Parallel I/O
- **Striping**: Distribute file across multiple nodes
- **Concurrent Access**: Multiple clients access different parts
- **Aggregation**: Combine small operations into larger ones
- **Prefetching**: Anticipate future access patterns

### Load Balancing
- **Request Distribution**: Spread load across nodes
- **Hot Spot Detection**: Identify and mitigate bottlenecks
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Move data based on access patterns
- **Capacity Planning**: Scale resources based on demand

## Fault Tolerance Mechanisms

### Node Failure Detection
```
Heartbeat Mechanism:
1. Nodes send periodic heartbeat messages
2. Master tracks node availability
3. Timeout indicates potential failure
4. Confirmation through multiple sources
5. Initiate recovery procedures
```

### Data Recovery
- **Replica Reconstruction**: Rebuild from remaining replicas
- **Checksum Verification**: Detect and correct corruption
- **Erasure Coding**: Efficient redundancy with lower overhead
- **Hot Standby**: Immediate failover to backup nodes

### Split-Brain Prevention
- **Quorum Systems**: Require majority for operations
- **Witness Nodes**: Tie-breaker for network partitions
- **Fencing**: Isolate failed nodes from shared resources
- **Leader Election**: Single authoritative node

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization
- **User Authentication**: Verify user identity
- **Access Control Lists**: Fine-grained permissions
- **Role-Based Access**: Group-based permissions
- **Integration**: LDAP, Kerberos, OAuth

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: Protect stored data
- **Encryption in Transit**: Secure network communication
- **Key Management**: Secure key distribution and rotation
- **Audit Logging**: Track access and modifications

### Network Security
- **VPN Integration**: Secure remote access

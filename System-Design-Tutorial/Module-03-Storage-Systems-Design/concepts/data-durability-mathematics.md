# Data Durability Mathematics

## Overview
Data durability quantifies the probability that data will not be lost over a given time period. Understanding durability mathematics is crucial for designing storage systems that meet business requirements for data protection and compliance.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Durability Definition
**Durability** = Probability that data survives for a specified time period
- Expressed as percentage (99.999999999%) or "nines" (11 nines)
- Calculated over annual time periods typically
- Inverse relationship with Annual Failure Rate (AFR)

### Annual Failure Rate (AFR)
```
AFR = 1 - Durability
Durability = 1 - AFR

Example:
99.999999999% durability = 0.000000001% AFR
```

### Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
```
MTBF = 1 / Failure Rate
MTBF (hours) = 8760 / AFR (annual)

Example:
AFR = 0.001% → MTBF = 8,760,000 hours ≈ 1000 years
```

## Single Component Durability

### Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Durability
```
Typical HDD AFR: 0.5% - 2%
Durability: 98% - 99.5%

Consumer HDD: AFR ≈ 2% → Durability = 98%
Enterprise HDD: AFR ≈ 0.5% → Durability = 99.5%
```

### Solid State Drive (SSD) Durability
```
Typical SSD AFR: 0.1% - 0.5%
Durability: 99.5% - 99.9%

Consumer SSD: AFR ≈ 0.5% → Durability = 99.5%
Enterprise SSD: AFR ≈ 0.1% → Durability = 99.9%
```

### Component Failure Modes
- **Mechanical Failure**: Moving parts wear out
- **Electronic Failure**: Circuit degradation
- **Firmware Corruption**: Software bugs
- **Environmental Factors**: Temperature, humidity, vibration

## Replication Mathematics

### Simple Replication (Independent Failures)
For N independent replicas with individual durability D:
```
System Durability = 1 - (1 - D)^N

Examples:
Single disk (D=99%): 99% durability
Two replicas: 1 - (1-0.99)² = 1 - 0.0001 = 99.99%
Three replicas: 1 - (1-0.99)³ = 1 - 0.000001 = 99.9999%
```

### Replication Factor Impact
```python
def calculate_durability(single_durability, replicas):
    failure_rate = 1 - single_durability
    system_failure_rate = failure_rate ** replicas
    return 1 - system_failure_rate

# Example calculations
single_durability = 0.99  # 99%
for replicas in range(1, 6):
    durability = calculate_durability(single_durability, replicas)
    nines = -math.log10(1 - durability)
    print(f"{replicas} replicas: {durability:.10f} ({nines:.1f} nines)")
```

### Correlated Failures
Real-world failures are not always independent:
```
Correlated Failure Probability (C): 0.01 - 0.1
Effective Durability = D_independent × (1 - C)

Example:
Independent durability: 99.99%
Correlation factor: 0.05 (5%)
Effective durability: 99.99% × 0.95 = 94.99%
```

## Erasure Coding Mathematics

### Reed-Solomon Coding
For (n,k) erasure coding (k data blocks, n-k parity blocks):
```
Can tolerate up to (n-k) failures
Storage overhead = n/k

Example: (10,6) coding
- 6 data blocks, 4 parity blocks
- Can lose any 4 blocks
- Storage overhead = 10/6 = 1.67x
```

### Durability Calculation
```python
from math import comb

def erasure_coding_durability(n, k, block_failure_rate):
    """Calculate durability for (n,k) erasure coding"""
    durability = 0
    max_failures = n - k
    
    for failures in range(max_failures + 1):
        # Probability of exactly 'failures' blocks failing
        prob = comb(n, failures) * (block_failure_rate ** failures) * ((1 - block_failure_rate) ** (n - failures))
        durability += prob
    
    return durability

# Example: (10,6) with 1% block failure rate
durability = erasure_coding_durability(10, 6, 0.01)
print(f"Durability: {durability:.10f}")
```

### Comparison: Replication vs Erasure Coding
```
Scenario: 99% single disk durability, 10 disks total

3x Replication:
- Usable capacity: 33%
- Durability: 1 - (0.01)³ = 99.9999%

(10,6) Erasure Coding:
- Usable capacity: 60%
- Durability: 99.999999% (calculated)
- Better space efficiency with similar durability
```

## Geographic Distribution

### Multi-Region Durability
```
Single Region Durability: D_region
Multi-Region Durability: 1 - (1 - D_region)^N_regions

Example:
Single region: 99.999999999% (11 nines)
Two regions: 1 - (10^-11)² ≈ 99.999999999% (still 11 nines)
```

### Regional Failure Scenarios
- **Natural Disasters**: Earthquakes, floods, hurricanes
- **Power Grid Failures**: Extended outages
- **Network Partitions**: Connectivity loss
- **Regulatory Issues**: Data access restrictions

### Cross-Region Replication Mathematics
```python
def multi_region_durability(regional_durability, num_regions, correlation=0):
    """Calculate multi-region durability with optional correlation"""
    if correlation == 0:
        # Independent regional failures
        failure_rate = 1 - regional_durability
        system_failure_rate = failure_rate ** num_regions
        return 1 - system_failure_rate
    else:
        # Correlated regional failures
        independent_durability = multi_region_durability(regional_durability, num_regions, 0)
        return independent_durability * (1 - correlation)

# Examples
regional_durability = 0.99999999999  # 11 nines
print(f"2 regions (independent): {multi_region_durability(regional_durability, 2):.15f}")
print(f"2 regions (5% correlation): {multi_region_durability(regional_durability, 2, 0.05):.15f}")
```

## Time-Based Durability Analysis

### Durability Over Time
```python
def durability_over_time(annual_durability, years):
    """Calculate durability over multiple years"""
    annual_failure_rate = 1 - annual_durability
    multi_year_failure_rate = 1 - (1 - annual_failure_rate) ** years
    return 1 - multi_year_failure_rate

# Example: 99.999999999% annual durability
for years in [1, 5, 10, 20]:
    durability = durability_over_time(0.99999999999, years)
    print(f"{years} years: {durability:.10f}")
```

### Degradation Factors
- **Component Aging**: Failure rates increase over time
- **Technology Obsolescence**: Hardware becomes unsupported
- **Environmental Wear**: Cumulative stress effects
- **Maintenance Quality**: Operational procedures impact

## Cost-Durability Trade-offs

### Storage Cost Analysis
```python
def storage_cost_analysis(base_cost_per_gb, durability_target):
    """Analyze cost for different durability approaches"""
    scenarios = {
        "Single disk": {"replicas": 1, "durability": 0.99, "overhead": 1.0},
        "2x replication": {"replicas": 2, "durability": 0.9999, "overhead": 2.0},
        "3x replication": {"replicas": 3, "durability": 0.999999, "overhead": 3.0},
        "(6,4) erasure": {"replicas": 1.5, "durability": 0.999999999, "overhead": 1.5},
        "(10,6) erasure": {"replicas": 1.67, "durability": 0.9999999999, "overhead": 1.67}
    }
    
    for name, config in scenarios.items():
        cost = base_cost_per_gb * config["overhead"]
        meets_target = config["durability"] >= durability_target
        print(f"{name}: ${cost:.2f}/GB, {config['durability']:.10f}, {'✓' if meets_target else '✗'}")

# Example analysis
storage_cost_analysis(0.10, 0.999999999)  # Target: 9 nines
```

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
```
TCO Components:
- Storage hardware costs
- Network bandwidth costs
- Operational overhead
- Recovery costs (when failures occur)
- Compliance and audit costs

TCO = Hardware + Network + Operations + Recovery + Compliance
```

## Monitoring and Validation

### Durability Metrics
```python
class DurabilityMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.total_objects = 0
        self.lost_objects = 0
        self.monitoring_period = 365  # days
    
    def record_loss(self, objects_lost):
        self.lost_objects += objects_lost
    
    def calculate_observed_durability(self):
        if self.total_objects == 0:
            return 1.0
        loss_rate = self.lost_objects / self.total_objects
        return 1 - loss_rate
    
    def durability_sla_compliance(self, target_durability):
        observed = self.calculate_observed_durability()
        return observed >= target_durability
```

### Testing Strategies
- **Chaos Engineering**: Intentional failure injection
- **Disaster Recovery Drills**: Validate recovery procedures
- **Data Integrity Checks**: Continuous verification
- **Performance Under Failure**: Measure degraded performance

## Best Practices

### Design Principles
1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple protection layers
2. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Assume failures will occur
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain service during failures
4. **Automated Recovery**: Minimize manual intervention
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time durability tracking

### Implementation Guidelines
```
Durability Requirements Analysis:
1. Define business requirements (RPO/RTO)
2. Calculate required durability level
3. Analyze failure modes and correlations
4. Design redundancy strategy
5. Implement monitoring and alerting
6. Test failure scenarios regularly
7. Document recovery procedures
```

### Common Pitfalls
- **Ignoring Correlated Failures**: Overestimating durability
- **Insufficient Testing**: Untested recovery procedures
- **Single Points of Failure**: Metadata servers, network links
- **Inadequate Monitoring**: Missing early warning signs
- **Poor Operational Procedures**: Human errors during recovery

## Conclusion

Data durability mathematics provides the foundation for designing robust storage systems. Understanding the relationship between component reliability, replication strategies, and system-level durability enables informed architectural decisions that balance cost, performance, and data protection requirements. Regular monitoring and testing validate theoretical calculations against real-world performance.

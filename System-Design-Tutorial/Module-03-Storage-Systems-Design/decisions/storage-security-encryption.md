# ADR-03-005: Storage Security and Encryption

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Data security is critical for protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access, both at rest and in transit. Regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX) mandate encryption for certain data types. We need a comprehensive encryption strategy that protects data while maintaining performance and operational efficiency.

## Decision
Implement comprehensive encryption at rest and in transit for all storage systems:

### Encryption Strategy
1. **Encryption at Rest**: All stored data encrypted using strong encryption algorithms
2. **Encryption in Transit**: All data transfers protected with TLS/SSL
3. **Key Management**: Centralized key management with AWS KMS
4. **Access Control**: Fine-grained access controls with IAM and resource policies
5. **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for data protection

### Encryption Implementation by Storage Type
```yaml
Block Storage (EBS):
  - Default encryption enabled for all volumes
  - Customer-managed KMS keys for sensitive data
  - Encrypted snapshots and AMIs
  - In-transit encryption for EBS-optimized instances

Object Storage (S3):
  - Server-side encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C)
  - Client-side encryption for highly sensitive data
  - Bucket-level encryption policies
  - HTTPS-only access policies

File Storage (EFS/FSx):
  - Encryption at rest using KMS keys
  - Encryption in transit using TLS
  - Access point-level encryption controls
  - POSIX permissions integration

Database Storage:
  - Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
  - Encrypted backups and snapshots
  - SSL/TLS for database connections
  - Column-level encryption for PII
```

### Key Management Architecture
- **AWS KMS**: Primary key management service
- **Customer-Managed Keys**: For sensitive data requiring full control
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic annual key rotation
- **Key Policies**: Fine-grained access control for encryption keys
- **Cross-Region Keys**: Multi-region key replication for disaster recovery

## Rationale
This strategy provides:
- **Data Protection**: Comprehensive protection against unauthorized access
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets encryption requirements for various regulations
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of encryption and access control
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated encryption with minimal performance impact
- **Audit Capability**: Complete audit trail for encryption and key usage

## Consequences

### Positive
- Strong protection against data breaches and unauthorized access
- Compliance with regulatory encryption requirements
- Centralized key management and audit capabilities
- Minimal performance impact with hardware-accelerated encryption
- Enhanced customer trust and confidence

### Negative
- Additional complexity in key management and access control
- Potential performance overhead for encryption/decryption operations
- Increased costs for KMS key usage and operations
- Need for specialized knowledge in encryption and key management
- Potential data recovery challenges if keys are lost

## Alternatives Considered

### Application-Level Encryption Only
- **Pros**: Full control over encryption implementation
- **Cons**: Complex implementation, potential security vulnerabilities
- **Partially Adopted**: Use for specific sensitive fields requiring client-side encryption

### Third-Party Encryption Solutions
- **Pros**: Advanced features, unified management
- **Cons**: Additional costs, vendor lock-in, integration complexity
- **Rejected**: AWS KMS provides sufficient capabilities for our needs

### No Encryption (Compliance Permitting)
- **Pros**: Simpler architecture, better performance
- **Cons**: Security risks, regulatory non-compliance
- **Rejected**: Unacceptable security risk for sensitive data

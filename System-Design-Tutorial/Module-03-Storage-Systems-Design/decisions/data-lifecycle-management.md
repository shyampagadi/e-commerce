# ADR-03-004: Data Lifecycle Management

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Data grows continuously and access patterns change over time. Without proper lifecycle management, storage costs increase unnecessarily while performance may degrade due to mixing hot and cold data. We need automated policies to optimize storage costs and performance based on data age and access patterns.

## Decision
Implement automated data lifecycle management with intelligent tiering and archival policies:

### Lifecycle Management Framework
1. **Data Classification**: Categorize data by business value and access patterns
2. **Automated Tiering**: Move data between storage tiers based on age and access
3. **Archival Policies**: Transition old data to cost-effective archive storage
4. **Deletion Policies**: Remove data that has exceeded retention requirements
5. **Compliance Integration**: Ensure lifecycle policies meet regulatory requirements

### Lifecycle Stages
```yaml
Active Stage (0-30 days):
  - Storage: High-performance tiers (EBS SSD, S3 Standard)
  - Access: Frequent, low-latency required
  - Cost: Higher per GB, optimized for performance

Inactive Stage (30-90 days):
  - Storage: Standard tiers (EBS GP3, S3 Standard-IA)
  - Access: Occasional, moderate latency acceptable
  - Cost: Balanced performance and cost

Archive Stage (90 days - 7 years):
  - Storage: Archive tiers (S3 Glacier, S3 Deep Archive)
  - Access: Rare, retrieval time acceptable
  - Cost: Lowest per GB, optimized for long-term storage

Deletion Stage (> retention period):
  - Action: Secure deletion with audit trail
  - Compliance: Meet regulatory deletion requirements
  - Verification: Confirm complete data removal
```

### Automated Lifecycle Policies
- **S3 Lifecycle Rules**: Automatic transitions between storage classes
- **EBS Snapshot Lifecycle**: Automated snapshot creation and deletion
- **Database Archival**: Move old records to archive tables or storage
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic log archival and cleanup

## Rationale
This approach provides:
- **Cost Optimization**: Significant reduction in storage costs over time
- **Performance Optimization**: Keep frequently accessed data on fast storage
- **Compliance**: Automated retention and deletion for regulatory requirements
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduced manual data management overhead
- **Storage Optimization**: Prevent storage sprawl and improve utilization

## Consequences

### Positive
- Substantial cost savings through intelligent data tiering
- Improved performance by separating hot and cold data
- Automated compliance with data retention policies
- Reduced operational overhead for data management
- Better storage utilization and capacity planning

### Negative
- Initial complexity in setting up lifecycle policies
- Potential data retrieval delays for archived data
- Risk of premature data deletion if policies are misconfigured
- Need for careful monitoring of lifecycle policy effectiveness
- Possible application changes required for archive data access

## Alternatives Considered

### Manual Data Management
- **Pros**: Full control over data placement decisions
- **Cons**: Labor-intensive, prone to errors, not scalable
- **Rejected**: Not feasible for large-scale data management

### Single Storage Tier
- **Pros**: Simple architecture, no data movement complexity
- **Cons**: Suboptimal costs, performance issues with mixed workloads
- **Rejected**: Doesn't optimize for cost or performance

### Third-Party Lifecycle Management
- **Pros**: Advanced features, unified management across platforms
- **Cons**: Additional costs, vendor lock-in, integration complexity
- **Future Consideration**: May evaluate for complex multi-cloud scenarios

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: S3 Lifecycle Policies (Week 1)
```yaml
Standard to IA Transition:
  - Transition after 30 days of no access
  - Apply to all objects > 128KB
  - Exclude frequently accessed buckets
  - Monitor transition costs vs savings

IA to Glacier Transition:
  - Transition after 90 days in IA
  - Apply to all objects except active datasets
  - Configure retrieval notifications
  - Set up cost monitoring

Glacier to Deep Archive:
  - Transition after 180 days in Glacier
  - Apply to compliance and backup data
  - Document retrieval procedures
  - Implement access request workflows
```

### Phase 2: EBS Snapshot Lifecycle (Week 2)
```yaml
Snapshot Creation:
  - Daily snapshots for critical volumes
  - Weekly snapshots for standard volumes
  - Tag snapshots with metadata
  - Cross-region copy for critical data

Snapshot Retention:
  - Keep daily snapshots for 30 days
  - Keep weekly snapshots for 12 weeks
  - Keep monthly snapshots for 12 months
  - Archive yearly snapshots for 7 years

Snapshot Cleanup:
  - Automated deletion of expired snapshots
  - Orphaned snapshot identification
  - Cost optimization analysis
  - Retention policy compliance verification
```

### Phase 3: Database Lifecycle Management (Week 3)
```yaml
Table Partitioning:
  - Partition tables by date/time
  - Archive old partitions to separate storage
  - Implement partition pruning for queries
  - Automate partition maintenance

Data Archival:
  - Move old records to archive tables
  - Compress archived data
  - Maintain referential integrity
  - Provide archive data access methods

Log Management:
  - Rotate application logs daily
  - Compress and archive old logs
  - Implement log retention policies
  - Provide log search and analysis tools
```

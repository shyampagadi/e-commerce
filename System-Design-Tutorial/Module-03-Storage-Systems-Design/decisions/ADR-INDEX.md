# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) - Module 03

## Overview
This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Module-03: Storage Systems Design. ADRs document important architectural decisions made for storage infrastructure and data management solutions.

## ADR Status Legend
- **Proposed**: Decision is under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Current ADRs for Module-03

### ADR-03-001: Storage Architecture Strategy
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Implement polyglot storage strategy with multiple storage types
- **Rationale**: Different data types require different storage optimizations
- **File**: [storage-architecture-strategy.md](./storage-architecture-strategy.md)

### ADR-03-002: Data Durability and Backup Strategy
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Implement multi-tier backup strategy with cross-region replication
- **Rationale**: Ensures data protection and business continuity
- **File**: [data-durability-backup-strategy.md](./data-durability-backup-strategy.md)

### ADR-03-003: Storage Performance Optimization
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Use tiered storage with intelligent data placement
- **Rationale**: Optimizes performance and cost based on access patterns
- **File**: [storage-performance-optimization.md](./storage-performance-optimization.md)

### ADR-03-004: Data Lifecycle Management
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Implement automated data lifecycle policies
- **Rationale**: Reduces storage costs and improves data governance
- **File**: [data-lifecycle-management.md](./data-lifecycle-management.md)

### ADR-03-005: Storage Security and Encryption
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Decision**: Implement encryption at rest and in transit for all storage
- **Rationale**: Ensures data protection and regulatory compliance
- **File**: [storage-security-encryption.md](./storage-security-encryption.md)

## Guidelines for Creating ADRs

### When to Create an ADR
- Storage technology selection decisions
- Data durability and backup strategies
- Performance optimization approaches
- Security and encryption policies
- Data lifecycle and governance decisions

### ADR Template
Use the following template for new ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-03-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded]

## Context
[Background and problem statement]

## Decision
[The architectural decision made]

## Rationale
[Why this decision was made]

## Consequences
[Positive and negative consequences]

## Alternatives Considered
[Other options that were considered]

## Implementation Notes
[How to implement this decision]

## Related ADRs
[Links to related ADRs]
```

### Naming Convention
- Format: `ADR-03-XXX-descriptive-name.md`
- XXX: Three-digit number (001, 002, 003, etc.)
- Use kebab-case for descriptive name

## Review Process

### ADR Review Steps
1. **Draft**: Create ADR with proposed status
2. **Review**: Storage team reviews the ADR
3. **Discussion**: Address feedback and concerns
4. **Approval**: Change status to accepted
5. **Implementation**: Implement the decision
6. **Monitoring**: Monitor consequences and update if needed

# ADR-03-002: Data Durability and Backup Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Data durability and backup strategy decisions have critical business impact, affecting data protection, recovery capabilities, compliance requirements, and operational costs. Different backup approaches have varying trade-offs between protection levels, recovery times, and investment costs. A systematic framework is needed to determine optimal data protection strategies.

## Decision
Implement a risk-based data protection strategy using a business impact assessment framework that aligns backup investment with data criticality and recovery requirements.

## Data Protection Strategy Decision Framework

### Core Decision Question
**"What level of data protection investment provides optimal risk mitigation for our specific data criticality, business requirements, and regulatory obligations?"**

### Data Criticality Assessment Matrix
| Data Category | Business Impact | Recovery Time Requirement | Recovery Point Requirement | Protection Investment | Priority Score |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Mission Critical** | Revenue loss (9) | < 1 hour (9) | < 15 minutes (9) | High | **9.0** |
| **Business Important** | Operational impact (7) | < 4 hours (7) | < 1 hour (7) | Medium | **7.0** |
| **Operational** | Process disruption (5) | < 24 hours (5) | < 4 hours (5) | Low | **5.0** |
| **Archival** | Compliance only (3) | < 72 hours (3) | < 24 hours (3) | Minimal | **3.0** |

# ADR-03-001: Storage Architecture Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our SaaS platform needs to store 500GB of data (growing to 5TB over 3 years), serve 100K users with mixed workloads: user files (documents, images), application data (user profiles, settings), analytics data (logs, metrics), and backups. Current single MySQL database is hitting performance limits.

## Decision
Implement polyglot storage strategy with specific AWS services matched to data characteristics and access patterns through systematic evaluation framework.

## Alternative Analysis Summary

### Rejected Approaches
| Approach | Score | Rejection Rationale | Key Limitation |
|----------|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Single MySQL** | 5.2 | Performance bottlenecks, scaling limitations | Cannot handle diverse workloads |

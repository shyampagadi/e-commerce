## Storage Performance Optimization

### EBS Performance Tuning
```yaml
Volume Type Selection:
  gp3 (General Purpose):
    Use Case: Most workloads, cost-sensitive
    Baseline: 3,000 IOPS, 125 MB/s
    Burst: Up to 16,000 IOPS, 1,000 MB/s
    Cost: $0.08/GB + $0.005/provisioned IOPS
  
  io2 (Provisioned IOPS):
    Use Case: I/O intensive, consistent performance
    Performance: Up to 64,000 IOPS, 1,000 MB/s
    Durability: 99.999% (vs 99.999% for gp3)
    Cost: $0.125/GB + $0.065/provisioned IOPS
  
  io2 Block Express:
    Use Case: Highest performance requirements
    Performance: Up to 256,000 IOPS, 4,000 MB/s
    Latency: Sub-millisecond
    Cost: $0.125/GB + $0.065/provisioned IOPS

Optimization Strategies:
  RAID Configuration:
    RAID 0: 2x throughput, no redundancy
    RAID 1: Redundancy, same performance
    RAID 10: 2x throughput + redundancy
  
  File System Tuning:
    ext4: noatime,data=writeback for performance
    xfs: Better for large files and concurrent access
    ZFS: Advanced features, higher overhead
  
  Application Optimization:
    Direct I/O: Bypass OS cache for databases
    Async I/O: Non-blocking I/O operations
    Batch Operations: Reduce I/O overhead
```

### S3 Performance Optimization
```yaml
Request Rate Optimization:
  Prefix Distribution: Avoid sequential prefixes
  Multipart Upload: Files >100MB, parallel uploads
  Transfer Acceleration: Global upload optimization
  
Example Prefix Strategy:
  Bad: logs/2024/01/01/hour01/file1.log
  Good: a1b2c3d4/logs/2024/01/01/hour01/file1.log
  
Performance Results:
  - 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE requests per second per prefix
  - 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix
  - 100+ Gbps throughput with proper prefixing
  
Cost Optimization:
  Request Costs:
    PUT/POST: $0.0005 per 1,000 requests
    GET: $0.0004 per 1,000 requests
    DELETE: Free
  
  Storage Classes:
    Standard: $0.023/GB (frequent access)
    IA: $0.0125/GB + $0.01/GB retrieval
    Glacier: $0.004/GB + $0.03/GB retrieval
    Deep Archive: $0.00099/GB + $0.02/GB retrieval
```

### Database Storage Strategies
```yaml
OLTP Database Storage:
  Primary Storage: EBS io2 (consistent IOPS)
  Log Storage: EBS gp3 (sequential writes)
  Backup Storage: S3 (point-in-time recovery)
  
Configuration Example (PostgreSQL):
  Data Volume: io2, 20,000 IOPS, 1TB
  WAL Volume: gp3, 3,000 IOPS, 100GB

Performance Tuning:
  shared_buffers: 25% of RAM
  effective_cache_size: 75% of RAM
  wal_buffers: 16MB
  checkpoint_segments: 32
  
OLAP Database Storage:
  Primary Storage: S3 (columnar data)
  Cache Storage: EBS gp3 (query cache)

      Status: Enabled
      Filter:
        Prefix: "products/"
      Transitions:
        - Days: 30
          StorageClass: STANDARD_IA
        - Days: 90
          StorageClass: GLACIER
        - Days: 365
          StorageClass: DEEP_ARCHIVE
      
    - Id: "LogFiles"
      Status: Enabled
      Filter:
        Prefix: "logs/"
      Transitions:
        - Days: 7
          StorageClass: STANDARD_IA
        - Days: 30
          StorageClass: GLACIER
      Expiration:
        Days: 2555  # 7 years for compliance

EBS Snapshot Lifecycle:
  Daily Snapshots: Retain for 7 days
  Weekly Snapshots: Retain for 4 weeks
  Monthly Snapshots: Retain for 12 months
  Yearly Snapshots: Retain for 7 years
  
  Cost Impact:
    - Daily snapshots: $0.05/GB/month
    - Incremental storage: Only changed blocks
    - Cross-region copy: Additional $0.02/GB
    - Automated deletion: Prevent cost accumulation
```

### Data Archival Strategy
```yaml
Archive Decision Matrix:
  Access Frequency:
    Daily: S3 Standard
    Weekly: S3 Standard-IA
    Monthly: S3 Glacier
    Yearly: S3 Glacier Deep Archive
  
  Retrieval Requirements:
    Immediate (ms): S3 Standard
    Fast (1-5 min): S3 Standard-IA
    Standard (3-5 hours): S3 Glacier
    Bulk (12 hours): S3 Glacier Deep Archive
  
  Cost Comparison (1TB, 1 year):
    S3 Standard: $276
    S3 Standard-IA: $150 + retrieval costs
    S3 Glacier: $48 + retrieval costs
    S3 Deep Archive: $12 + retrieval costs
```

## Disaster Recovery and Backup

### Multi-Region Backup Strategy
```yaml
RTO/RPO Requirements:
  Tier 1 (Critical): RTO <1 hour, RPO <15 minutes
  Tier 2 (Important): RTO <4 hours, RPO <1 hour
  Tier 3 (Standard): RTO <24 hours, RPO <4 hours
  
Backup Architecture:
  Primary Region: us-east-1
  DR Region: us-west-2
  Archive Region: eu-west-1 (compliance)
  
Implementation:
  Database Backups:
    RDS: Automated backups + manual snapshots
    Cross-region: Automated snapshot copying
    Point-in-time: 35-day retention
  
  File System Backups:
    EFS: AWS Backup service
    Schedule: Daily incremental, weekly full
    Retention: 30 days local, 1 year cross-region
  
  Application Data:
    S3: Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
    Versioning: Enabled with lifecycle policies
    MFA Delete: Enabled for critical buckets
```

### Backup Cost Optimization
```yaml
Backup Storage Costs:
  Local Backups: Same region storage rates
  Cross-region: +$0.02/GB transfer cost
  Archive Storage: 70-95% cost reduction
  
Optimization Strategies:
  Incremental Backups: Only changed data
  Compression: 50-80% size reduction
  Deduplication: 30-70% space savings
  Lifecycle Policies: Automatic tier transitions
  
Cost Example (1TB database):
  Daily full backup: $276/year (S3 Standard)
  Daily incremental: $55/year (20% change rate)
  With compression: $28/year (50% compression)
  With archival: $14/year (Glacier after 30 days)
```

## Security and Compliance

### Encryption Strategy
```yaml
Encryption at Rest:
  S3: SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C
  EBS: KMS encryption (default or custom keys)

  EFS: KMS encryption for file system
  
Encryption in Transit:
  S3: HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ required
  EBS: Encrypted between EC2 and EBS
  RDS: SSL/TLS connections enforced
  EFS: TLS 1.2 for NFS connections
  
Key Management:
  AWS Managed Keys: No additional cost
  Customer Managed Keys: $1/month per key
  CloudHSM: $1.45/hour per HSM instance
  
Compliance Requirements:
  PCI DSS: Encryption + access controls
  HIPAA: Encryption + audit logging
  SOX: Immutable storage + retention
  GDPR: Encryption + right to deletion
```

### Access Control Framework
```yaml
S3 Bucket Policies:
  Principle of Least Privilege: Minimum required access
  Resource-based Policies: Bucket and object level
  Condition Keys: IP, time, MFA requirements
  
Example Policy (Read-only access from VPC):
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VPCEndpointAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:sourceVpce": "vpce-1a2b3c4d"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

IAM Policies:
  Role-based Access: Separate roles for different functions
  Time-based Access: Temporary credentials with STS
  MFA Requirements: For sensitive operations
  
VPC Endpoints:
  S3 Gateway Endpoint: No internet routing required
  Interface Endpoints: Private connectivity to AWS services
  Cost: $0.01/hour per endpoint + data processing

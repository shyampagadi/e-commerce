# ADR-004: Service Decomposition Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context

We need to establish a consistent approach for decomposing monolithic applications into microservices. The current system is a monolithic e-commerce application that has grown to the point where it's becoming difficult to maintain, scale, and deploy independently. Different teams are working on different parts of the system, leading to coordination overhead and deployment bottlenecks.

### Current Challenges
- **Deployment Bottlenecks**: Single deployment pipeline affects all teams
- **Technology Constraints**: Cannot use different technologies for different parts
- **Scaling Issues**: Cannot scale different parts independently
- **Team Coordination**: Multiple teams working on same codebase
- **Testing Complexity**: End-to-end testing is becoming complex
- **Release Risk**: Changes in one area can break other areas

### Business Requirements
- **Independent Deployments**: Teams should be able to deploy independently
- **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use different technologies
- **Independent Scaling**: Services should scale based on their own needs
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams should own their services completely
- **Faster Time to Market**: Reduced coordination overhead
- **Better Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service shouldn't affect others

## Decision

We will use **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with business capability-based decomposition** as our primary strategy for service decomposition.

### Decomposition Approach
1. **Identify Bounded Contexts**: Use DDD to identify business domains
2. **Map Business Capabilities**: Identify distinct business capabilities
3. **Define Service Boundaries**: Create services around business capabilities
4. **Establish Data Ownership**: Each service owns its data
5. **Define Communication Patterns**: Establish how services communicate

### Service Decomposition Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one clear business purpose
2. **High Cohesion**: Related functionality stays together
3. **Loose Coupling**: Services are minimally dependent on each other
4. **Data Ownership**: Each service owns its data completely
5. **Team Alignment**: Service boundaries align with team boundaries
6. **Independent Deployability**: Services can be deployed independently

## Rationale

### Why Domain-Driven Design?
- **Business Alignment**: Aligns technical architecture with business domains
- **Clear Boundaries**: Provides clear criteria for service boundaries
- **Team Autonomy**: Enables teams to work independently
- **Maintainability**: Makes the system easier to understand and maintain
- **Scalability**: Allows independent scaling of business capabilities

### Why Business Capability-Based?
- **Business Value**: Each service delivers clear business value
- **Team Ownership**: Teams can own complete business capabilities
- **Independent Evolution**: Business capabilities can evolve independently
- **Clear Interfaces**: Business capabilities have clear interfaces
- **Measurable Impact**: Business capabilities have measurable outcomes

### Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **Technical Decomposition**: Rejected because it doesn't align with business needs
2. **Data-Driven Decomposition**: Rejected because it creates tight coupling
3. **Team-Driven Decomposition**: Rejected because it doesn't consider business logic
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Considered but DDD provides better structure

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work independently on their services
- **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use different technologies
- **Independent Scaling**: Services can scale based on their own needs
- **Faster Deployments**: Teams can deploy independently
- **Better Fault Isolation**: Failures are contained within services
- **Clear Ownership**: Clear ownership of business capabilities
- **Easier Testing**: Smaller, focused services are easier to test
- **Better Maintainability**: Services are easier to understand and maintain

### Negative Consequences
- **Increased Complexity**: More services means more operational complexity
- **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication adds latency
- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency challenges
- **Distributed Debugging**: Harder to debug across services
- **Operational Overhead**: More services to monitor and maintain
- **Learning Curve**: Teams need to learn microservices patterns
- **Initial Investment**: Significant upfront investment in infrastructure

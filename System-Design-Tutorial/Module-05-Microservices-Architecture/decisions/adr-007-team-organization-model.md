# ADR-007: Team Organization Model

## Status
Accepted

## Context

We need to establish a team organization model that supports our microservices architecture and enables teams to work independently while maintaining coordination and alignment. The current functional team structure is not suitable for microservices, as it creates dependencies and coordination overhead that prevent teams from moving fast and taking ownership of their services.

### Current Challenges
- **Functional Silos**: Teams organized by function (frontend, backend, database)
- **Coordination Overhead**: High coordination required between teams
- **Deployment Bottlenecks**: Multiple teams involved in deployments
- **Ownership Issues**: No clear ownership of business capabilities
- **Technology Constraints**: Teams cannot choose appropriate technologies
- **Slow Delivery**: Long lead times due to coordination

### Business Requirements
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams should be able to work independently
- **Service Ownership**: Clear ownership of services and business capabilities
- **Fast Delivery**: Reduced coordination overhead for faster delivery
- **Technology Flexibility**: Teams can choose appropriate technologies
- **Cross-functional Teams**: Teams should have all necessary skills
- **Scalability**: Organization should scale with business growth

## Decision

We will adopt the **Two-Pizza Team model with service ownership and cross-functional teams**.

### Team Organization Principles
1. **Two-Pizza Teams**: Teams small enough to be fed by two pizzas (6-8 people)
2. **Service Ownership**: Each team owns one or more services completely
3. **Cross-functional**: Teams have all necessary skills (dev, ops, QA, product)
4. **Business Alignment**: Teams aligned with business capabilities
5. **End-to-End Ownership**: Teams own entire service lifecycle
6. **Autonomous Decision Making**: Teams can make technical decisions independently

### Team Structure
- **Service Teams**: Own specific services and business capabilities
- **Platform Teams**: Provide shared infrastructure and tools
- **Enabling Teams**: Provide specialized expertise and support
- **Community of Practice**: Cross-team knowledge sharing

## Rationale

### Why Two-Pizza Teams?
- **Optimal Size**: Small enough for effective communication
- **Clear Ownership**: Each team can own complete services
- **Fast Decision Making**: Quick decisions without bureaucracy
- **High Productivity**: Small teams are more productive
- **Proven Model**: Used successfully by Amazon, Netflix, Spotify

### Why Service Ownership?
- **Clear Responsibility**: Each team knows what they own
- **End-to-End Ownership**: Teams own entire service lifecycle
- **Independent Delivery**: Teams can deliver independently
- **Technology Freedom**: Teams can choose appropriate technologies
- **Business Alignment**: Teams aligned with business value

### Why Cross-functional Teams?
- **Reduced Dependencies**: Teams have all necessary skills
- **Faster Delivery**: No waiting for other teams
- **Better Quality**: Teams understand full context
- **Shared Responsibility**: Everyone responsible for service success
- **Learning**: Team members learn from each other

### Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **Functional Teams**: Rejected due to coordination overhead
2. **Matrix Teams**: Rejected due to unclear ownership
3. **Squad Model**: Considered but Two-Pizza is simpler
4. **Hierarchical Teams**: Rejected due to slow decision making

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work independently
- **Clear Ownership**: Clear responsibility for services
- **Faster Delivery**: Reduced coordination overhead
- **Technology Flexibility**: Teams can choose appropriate technologies
- **Better Quality**: Teams understand full context
- **Learning Culture**: Team members learn from each other
- **Innovation**: Teams can experiment and innovate
- **Scalability**: Organization can scale with business

### Negative Consequences
- **Knowledge Silos**: Teams may become isolated
- **Duplication**: Potential duplication of effort
- **Coordination Challenges**: Need for cross-team coordination
- **Resource Allocation**: Difficult to balance team sizes
- **Career Development**: Limited exposure to other areas
- **Onboarding**: New team members need broader skills
- **Management Overhead**: More teams to manage

## Guidelines for Creating ADRs

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions that:
- **Affect Multiple Services**: Decisions that impact more than one microservice
- **Define Architecture Patterns**: Choices about fundamental architectural patterns
- **Impact Team Structure**: Decisions that affect how teams are organized
- **Involve Technology Selection**: Major technology choices for microservices
- **Define Standards**: Decisions that establish standards across services
- **Affect Data Architecture**: Choices about data management and consistency
- **Impact Security**: Security-related architectural decisions
- **Define Operational Procedures**: Decisions about monitoring, deployment, etc.

### ADR Template

Use the following template for new ADRs:

```markdown

[Background and problem statement that led to this decision]

## Decision
[The architectural decision that was made]

## Rationale
[Why this decision was made, including trade-offs considered]

## Review Process

### ADR Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Create ADR with proposed status
2. **Review**: Technical team and stakeholders review the ADR
3. **Discussion**: Address feedback, concerns, and questions
4. **Approval**: Change status to accepted after consensus
5. **Implementation**: Implement the decision with monitoring
6. **Evaluation**: Review outcomes and update if needed
7. **Maintenance**: Regular review and potential deprecation

### Review Criteria

- **Technical Soundness**: Is the decision technically correct and feasible?
- **Consistency**: Does it align with other architectural decisions?
- **Completeness**: Are all aspects of the decision covered?
- **Clarity**: Is the decision clearly documented and understandable?
- **Consequences**: Are the consequences well understood and acceptable?
- **Alternatives**: Were reasonable alternatives considered?
- **Implementation**: Is the implementation plan realistic?

### Review Participants

```
Start: Need to decompose service?
├─ Is it a business capability?
│  ├─ Yes → Create separate service
│  └─ No → Keep in existing service
├─ Is it a technical concern?
│  ├─ Yes → Consider shared library
│  └─ No → Evaluate business value
└─ Is it a data concern?
   ├─ Yes → Consider data service
   └─ No → Evaluate coupling
```

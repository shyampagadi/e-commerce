# ADR-005: Deployment Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context

We need to establish a deployment strategy for our microservices architecture that enables rapid, reliable, and safe deployments. The current monolithic deployment process is slow, risky, and prevents teams from deploying independently. With microservices, we need a strategy that supports independent deployments while maintaining system stability.

### Current Challenges
- **Deployment Bottlenecks**: Single deployment pipeline for entire monolith
- **High Risk**: Deployments affect entire system
- **Slow Rollback**: Difficult to rollback changes quickly
- **Team Dependencies**: Teams must coordinate deployments
- **Limited Testing**: Difficult to test changes in isolation
- **Resource Constraints**: Cannot test at production scale

### Business Requirements
- **Independent Deployments**: Teams must deploy independently
- **Low Risk**: Minimize deployment-related failures
- **Fast Rollback**: Quick recovery from failed deployments
- **Continuous Delivery**: Support for frequent deployments
- **Zero Downtime**: Maintain service availability during deployments
- **Cost Effective**: Minimize resource overhead

## Decision

We will implement a **Blue-Green deployment strategy with Canary releases for critical services**.

### Primary Strategy: Blue-Green Deployment
- **Two Identical Environments**: Blue (current) and Green (new)
- **Instant Switch**: Traffic switches instantly between environments
- **Zero Downtime**: No service interruption during deployments
- **Fast Rollback**: Instant rollback by switching traffic back

### Secondary Strategy: Canary Releases
- **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy to small percentage of users first
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor metrics during rollout
- **Automatic Rollback**: Rollback if metrics degrade
- **Risk Mitigation**: Minimize impact of potential issues

### Hybrid Approach
- **Blue-Green for Non-Critical Services**: Fast, safe deployments
- **Canary for Critical Services**: Gradual rollout with monitoring
- **Feature Flags**: Additional control over feature rollouts

## Rationale

### Why Blue-Green Deployment?
- **Zero Downtime**: Maintains service availability
- **Fast Rollback**: Instant recovery from failures
- **Low Risk**: Thorough testing before traffic switch
- **Simple Process**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Proven Pattern**: Widely used in production systems

### Why Canary Releases for Critical Services?
- **Risk Mitigation**: Gradual exposure to new changes
- **Real-world Testing**: Test with actual production traffic
- **Performance Validation**: Validate performance under real load
- **User Impact Minimization**: Limited users affected by issues
- **Data-driven Decisions**: Make rollback decisions based on metrics

### Why Hybrid Approach?
- **Flexibility**: Different strategies for different service types
- **Risk Management**: Appropriate risk level for each service
- **Resource Optimization**: Use resources efficiently
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can choose appropriate strategy

### Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **Rolling Deployment**: Rejected due to potential inconsistencies
2. **Recreate Deployment**: Rejected due to downtime
3. **A/B Testing**: Rejected as not suitable for all deployments
4. **Shadow Deployment**: Rejected due to complexity and cost

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Zero Downtime**: No service interruption during deployments
- **Fast Rollback**: Quick recovery from failed deployments
- **Independent Deployments**: Teams can deploy independently
- **Risk Reduction**: Lower risk of deployment failures

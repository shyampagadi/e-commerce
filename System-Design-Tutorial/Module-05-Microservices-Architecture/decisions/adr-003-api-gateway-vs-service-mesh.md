# ADR-003: API Gateway vs Service Mesh

## Status
Accepted

## Context

In designing our microservices architecture for the e-commerce platform, we need to decide on the traffic management strategy. The choice between API Gateway, Service Mesh, or both will significantly impact how we handle external and internal traffic, security, and observability.

### Current Situation
- We have 8 core microservices (User, Product, Order, Payment, Inventory, Notification, Analytics, Search)
- Services need to communicate both externally (client requests) and internally (service-to-service)
- We need comprehensive traffic management, security, and observability
- The system needs to scale and handle high traffic volumes
- We need to support multiple client types (web, mobile, API consumers)

### Problem
We need to choose the appropriate traffic management strategy that provides:
- External API management and routing
- Internal service-to-service communication
- Security and authentication
- Load balancing and traffic management
- Monitoring and observability
- Performance optimization

## Decision

We will implement **both API Gateway and Service Mesh** with the following architecture:

### API Gateway for External Traffic
- **Primary Purpose**: Handle all external client requests
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Request routing to appropriate services
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Rate limiting and throttling
  - API versioning and management
  - Request/response transformation
  - Monitoring and analytics

### Service Mesh for Internal Traffic
- **Primary Purpose**: Handle service-to-service communication
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Service discovery and load balancing
  - Circuit breaker and retry logic
  - mTLS for service communication
  - Traffic management and routing
  - Observability and monitoring
  - Security policies enforcement

### Implementation Strategy
1. **AWS API Gateway**: For external API management
2. **AWS App Mesh**: For service mesh functionality
3. **Integration**: Seamless integration between both layers
4. **Monitoring**: Unified monitoring across both layers
5. **Security**: Layered security approach

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Comprehensive Traffic Management**: Handle both external and internal traffic effectively
- **Layered Security**: Multiple security layers for better protection
- **Flexible Routing**: Different routing strategies for different traffic types
- **Better Observability**: Complete visibility into all traffic flows
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize both external and internal communication
- **Scalability**: Scale external and internal traffic independently

### Negative
- **Complexity**: More complex architecture with two traffic management layers
- **Operational Overhead**: More components to manage and monitor
- **Cost**: Higher costs due to multiple services
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand both technologies
- **Integration Challenges**: Ensuring seamless integration between layers

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: API Gateway Only
**Pros:**
- Simpler architecture
- Single point of management
- Lower operational overhead
- Cost-effective

**Cons:**
- Limited internal traffic management
- Less granular control over service communication
- Limited service mesh features
- Single point of failure

### Option 2: Service Mesh Only
**Pros:**
- Comprehensive service-to-service communication
- Advanced traffic management features
- Better observability
- Service mesh benefits

**Cons:**
- Limited external API management
- Complex for simple external APIs
- Higher complexity
- May be overkill for external traffic

### Option 3: Custom Solution
**Pros:**
- Complete control over implementation
- Customized for specific needs
- No vendor lock-in

**Cons:**
- High development effort
- Maintenance overhead
- Limited features compared to managed services
- Security and reliability concerns

## Rationale

The hybrid approach was chosen because:

1. **Different Traffic Types**: External and internal traffic have different requirements and characteristics

2. **Specialized Tools**: API Gateway and Service Mesh are optimized for different use cases:
   - API Gateway: External API management, authentication, rate limiting
   - Service Mesh: Service-to-service communication, traffic management, observability

3. **AWS Ecosystem**: AWS provides excellent integration between API Gateway and App Mesh

4. **Security**: Layered security approach provides better protection

5. **Scalability**: Can scale external and internal traffic independently

6. **Future-Proofing**: Provides flexibility for future requirements

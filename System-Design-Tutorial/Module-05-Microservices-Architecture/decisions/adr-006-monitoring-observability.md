# ADR-006: Monitoring and Observability

## Status
Accepted

## Context

We need to establish a comprehensive monitoring and observability strategy for our microservices architecture. The current monolithic system has basic monitoring, but with microservices, we need enhanced observability to understand system behavior, debug issues, and maintain service health across distributed services.

### Current Challenges
- **Limited Visibility**: Basic monitoring doesn't provide deep insights
- **Distributed Debugging**: Hard to trace requests across services
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Difficult to identify performance issues
- **Error Root Cause**: Hard to find root cause of errors
- **Service Dependencies**: Don't understand service interactions
- **Capacity Planning**: Difficult to plan for capacity needs

### Business Requirements
- **Service Health**: Monitor health of all services
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track performance metrics
- **Error Tracking**: Identify and track errors
- **Business Metrics**: Monitor business KPIs
- **Alerting**: Proactive alerting on issues
- **Debugging**: Easy debugging of distributed issues

## Decision

We will implement a **comprehensive observability strategy with metrics, logging, and distributed tracing**.

### Three Pillars of Observability
1. **Metrics**: Quantitative data about system behavior
2. **Logging**: Detailed event logs for debugging
3. **Tracing**: Request flow across distributed services

### Monitoring Stack
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Tracing**: Jaeger for distributed tracing
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty for incident management
- **APM**: New Relic for application performance monitoring

### Observability Levels
- **Infrastructure Level**: Server metrics, network metrics
- **Application Level**: Application metrics, business metrics
- **Service Level**: Service health, performance, errors
- **User Level**: User experience metrics, business KPIs

## Rationale

### Why Comprehensive Observability?
- **Distributed Complexity**: Microservices are inherently complex
- **Debugging Needs**: Need to trace requests across services
- **Performance Optimization**: Need detailed performance data
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Need to detect issues before they impact users
- **Business Insights**: Need to understand business impact

### Why Three Pillars?
- **Metrics**: For monitoring and alerting
- **Logging**: For debugging and analysis
- **Tracing**: For understanding request flow
- **Complementary**: Each pillar provides different insights
- **Industry Standard**: Widely adopted approach

### Why This Stack?
- **Prometheus**: Industry standard for metrics
- **Grafana**: Excellent visualization capabilities
- **ELK Stack**: Comprehensive logging solution
- **Jaeger**: CNCF project for distributed tracing
- **PagerDuty**: Proven incident management
- **New Relic**: Additional APM capabilities

### Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **Basic Monitoring Only**: Rejected due to insufficient visibility
2. **Cloud Provider Tools Only**: Rejected due to vendor lock-in
3. **Custom Solution**: Rejected due to complexity and maintenance
4. **Open Source Only**: Rejected due to missing enterprise features

## Consequences

# ADR-001: Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communication

## Status
Accepted

## Context

In designing our microservices architecture for the e-commerce platform, we need to decide on the primary communication pattern between services. The choice between synchronous and asynchronous communication will significantly impact system performance, scalability, and complexity.

### Current Situation
- We have 8 core microservices (User, Product, Order, Payment, Inventory, Notification, Analytics, Search)
- Services need to communicate for various operations (order processing, payment verification, inventory updates)
- We need to support high throughput (1,000 orders per minute) and low latency (< 200ms response time)
- The system needs to be resilient to service failures

### Problem
We need to choose the appropriate communication pattern that balances:
- Performance and latency requirements
- System reliability and fault tolerance
- Development complexity and maintainability
- Scalability and resource utilization

## Decision

We will implement a **hybrid communication approach** with the following guidelines:

### Synchronous Communication
Use synchronous communication for:
- **Critical path operations** that require immediate response
- **Data consistency** requirements where eventual consistency is not acceptable
- **User-facing operations** that need real-time feedback
- **Simple request-response** patterns with low coupling

**Examples:**
- User authentication and authorization
- Product catalog queries
- Order creation and validation
- Payment processing verification

### Asynchronous Communication
Use asynchronous communication for:
- **Non-critical operations** that can tolerate delays
- **Event-driven workflows** and notifications
- **Background processing** and data synchronization
- **High-volume operations** that benefit from decoupling

**Examples:**
- Order status updates and notifications
- Inventory synchronization across services
- Analytics data collection and processing
- Email and SMS notifications

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Primary Pattern**: REST APIs for synchronous communication
2. **Event-Driven**: Domain events for asynchronous communication
3. **Message Queue**: SQS for reliable message delivery
4. **Circuit Breaker**: Implement circuit breakers for synchronous calls
5. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed operations

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Performance**: Optimal performance for each use case
- **Scalability**: Better scalability through decoupling
- **Resilience**: Improved fault tolerance and error handling
- **Flexibility**: Ability to choose the right pattern for each scenario
- **User Experience**: Fast response times for critical operations

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Increased system complexity with multiple patterns
- **Development Overhead**: More patterns to implement and maintain
- **Testing**: More complex testing scenarios
- **Monitoring**: Need to monitor both patterns
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand both patterns

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Pure Synchronous Communication
**Pros:**
- Simple to understand and implement
- Immediate consistency
- Easier debugging and tracing
- Lower complexity

**Cons:**
- Tight coupling between services
- Cascading failures
- Limited scalability
- Poor performance for high-volume operations

### Option 2: Pure Asynchronous Communication
**Pros:**
- Loose coupling
- Better scalability
- Fault isolation
- High throughput

**Cons:**
- Eventual consistency challenges
- Complex error handling
- Difficult debugging
- Higher latency for user-facing operations

### Option 3: Event Sourcing with CQRS
**Pros:**
- Complete audit trail
- Temporal queries
- Event replay capabilities
- Decoupled read/write models

**Cons:**
- High complexity
- Learning curve
- Storage overhead
- Eventual consistency challenges

## Rationale

The hybrid approach was chosen because:

1. **Business Requirements**: Our e-commerce platform has both real-time requirements (user authentication, order creation) and background processing needs (notifications, analytics)

2. **Performance Optimization**: Synchronous communication provides the low latency needed for user-facing operations, while asynchronous communication handles high-volume background processing efficiently

3. **Fault Tolerance**: The combination allows us to isolate failures in non-critical operations while maintaining reliability for critical operations

4. **Scalability**: Asynchronous communication enables better scalability for high-volume operations like notifications and analytics

5. **Team Expertise**: The team has experience with both patterns, making implementation and maintenance feasible

6. **AWS Services**: AWS provides excellent support for both patterns (API Gateway for synchronous, SQS/SNS for asynchronous)

## Implementation Details

### Synchronous Communication
- **Protocol**: HTTP/REST with JSON
- **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway for routing and management
- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer
- **Circuit Breaker**: Hystrix or similar pattern
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds for most operations
- **Retry**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff

### Asynchronous Communication
- **Message Queue**: Amazon SQS for reliable delivery
- **Event Bus**: Amazon SNS for event broadcasting
- **Event Store**: DynamoDB for event persistence
- **Dead Letter Queue**: SQS DLQ for failed messages
- **Message TTL**: 14 days for message retention

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics**: CloudWatch metrics for both patterns
- **Tracing**: X-Ray for distributed tracing
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Alerting**: CloudWatch alarms for critical metrics

# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Module 05 - Microservices Architecture. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the design and implementation of microservices systems.

## ADR Structure

Each ADR follows a consistent structure:

### Header
- **Number**: Sequential ADR number
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Date**: Date of the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, Superseded

### Content
- **Context**: The situation and problem
- **Decision**: The architectural decision made
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative consequences
- **Alternatives**: Other options considered
- **Rationale**: Why this decision was made

## ADR List

### 1. Service Communication Pattern
- **ADR-001**: Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communication
- **ADR-002**: API Gateway vs Service Mesh
- **ADR-003**: Event-Driven Architecture

### 2. Data Management
- **ADR-004**: Database per Service vs Shared Database
- **ADR-005**: Event Sourcing vs CRUD
- **ADR-006**: CQRS Implementation

### 3. Deployment and Infrastructure
- **ADR-007**: Container Orchestration Platform
- **ADR-008**: Service Discovery Mechanism
- **ADR-009**: Load Balancing Strategy

### 4. Security and Monitoring
- **ADR-010**: Authentication and Authorization
- **ADR-011**: Monitoring and Observability
- **ADR-012**: Error Handling and Logging

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[Describe the situation and problem that led to this decision]

## Decision
[Describe the architectural decision made]

## Consequences
### Positive
- [List positive consequences]

### Negative
- [List negative consequences]

## Alternatives Considered
- [List other options that were considered]

## Rationale
[Explain why this decision was made]

## References

- [Link to related ADRs]
```

## Best Practices

### Writing ADRs
- **Be Specific**: Clearly describe the decision and context
- **Include Rationale**: Explain why the decision was made
- **Consider Consequences**: Document both positive and negative impacts
- **Keep Updated**: Update ADRs when decisions change
- **Link Related ADRs**: Reference related decisions

### Review Process
- **Stakeholder Review**: Include all relevant stakeholders
- **Technical Review**: Have technical experts review
- **Documentation**: Ensure proper documentation
- **Approval**: Get formal approval before implementation
- **Communication**: Communicate decisions to the team

## Maintenance

### Regular Review
- **Quarterly Review**: Review ADRs quarterly
- **Update Status**: Update status as needed
- **Archive Old ADRs**: Archive outdated ADRs
- **Consolidate**: Merge related ADRs when appropriate

### Version Control
- **Git Integration**: Store ADRs in version control
- **Change Tracking**: Track changes to ADRs
- **Branch Strategy**: Use branches for ADR updates
- **Merge Process**: Follow proper merge process

## Tools and Resources

### ADR Tools
- **ADR Tools**: Command-line tools for ADR management
- **Templates**: Standard ADR templates
- **Validation**: ADR validation tools
- **Generation**: Automated ADR generation

## Next Steps

1. **Review Existing ADRs**: Understand current decisions
2. **Create New ADRs**: Document new decisions
3. **Update ADRs**: Keep ADRs current
4. **Share Knowledge**: Share ADRs with the team
5. **Learn from ADRs**: Use ADRs for learning and reference

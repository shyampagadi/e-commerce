## Pattern Catalog

### Decomposition Patterns

#### 1. Decompose by Business Capability
**Intent**: Organize services around business capabilities rather than technical layers.

**Problem**: Monolithic applications organized by technical layers (UI, business logic, data access) create tight coupling and make it difficult to scale individual business functions.

**Solution**: Decompose the monolith into services, each responsible for a specific business capability.

**Example**:
```
E-commerce Platform:
- User Management Service (user registration, authentication)
- Product Catalog Service (product information, inventory)
- Order Processing Service (order creation, payment)
- Notification Service (email, SMS notifications)
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear business alignment
- Independent scaling
- Team autonomy
- Reduced coupling

**Drawbacks**:
- Data consistency challenges
- Network latency
- Operational complexity
- Service coordination

#### 2. Strangler Fig Pattern
**Intent**: Gradually replace a legacy system by building a new system around the edges of the old system.

**Problem**: Replacing a large, complex legacy system all at once is risky and often infeasible.

**Solution**: Gradually replace functionality by building new services that implement the same interface as the legacy system.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Identify functionality to replace
2. Create new service with same interface
3. Implement facade to route requests
4. Gradually migrate traffic to new service
5. Remove old functionality

**Benefits**:
- Risk mitigation
- Gradual migration
- Learning opportunity
- Rollback capability

**Drawbacks**:
- Complex implementation
- Temporary duplication
- Data synchronization
- Testing complexity

### Communication Patterns

#### 1. API Gateway Pattern
**Intent**: Provide a single entry point for all client requests to microservices.

**Problem**: Clients need to know about multiple services and their locations, leading to tight coupling and complexity.

**Solution**: Implement an API Gateway that acts as a single entry point for all client requests.

**Responsibilities**:
- Request routing
- Protocol translation
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Monitoring and logging

**Benefits**:
- Simplified client code
- Centralized cross-cutting concerns
- Protocol translation
- Security enforcement

**Drawbacks**:
- Single point of failure
- Performance bottleneck
- Operational complexity
- Version management

#### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
**Intent**: Use events to communicate between services asynchronously.

**Problem**: Synchronous communication between services creates tight coupling and can cause cascading failures.

**Solution**: Use events to communicate between services, enabling loose coupling and better fault tolerance.

**Components**:
- Event Producer: Publishes events
- Event Store: Stores events
- Event Consumer: Consumes events
- Event Bus: Routes events

**Benefits**:
- Loose coupling
- Better scalability
- Fault tolerance
- Eventual consistency

**Drawbacks**:
- Eventual consistency
- Complex debugging
- Event ordering
- Message delivery guarantees

### Data Management Patterns

#### 1. Database per Service
**Intent**: Each microservice has its own database that is not shared with other services.

**Problem**: Sharing a database between services creates tight coupling and makes it difficult to scale services independently.

**Solution**: Give each service its own database, ensuring data isolation and service independence.

**Benefits**:
- Data isolation
- Independent scaling
- Technology diversity
- Service autonomy

**Drawbacks**:
- Data consistency challenges
- Distributed transactions
- Data synchronization
- Operational complexity

#### 2. Saga Pattern
**Intent**: Manage distributed transactions across multiple services using a sequence of local transactions.

**Problem**: Traditional ACID transactions don't work across service boundaries in microservices.

**Solution**: Use sagas to manage distributed transactions by coordinating a sequence of local transactions.

**Types**:
- **Choreography**: Services coordinate by publishing events
- **Orchestration**: Central coordinator manages the saga

**Benefits**:
- Distributed transaction management
- Fault tolerance
- Eventual consistency
- Service autonomy

**Drawbacks**:
- Complex implementation
- Eventual consistency
- Debugging complexity
- Rollback complexity

### Reliability Patterns

#### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern
**Intent**: Prevent cascading failures by monitoring service calls and opening the circuit when failures exceed a threshold.

**Problem**: When a service fails, calling services continue to make requests, potentially causing cascading failures.

**Solution**: Implement a circuit breaker that monitors service calls and opens the circuit when failures exceed a threshold.

**States**:
- **Closed**: Normal operation
- **Open**: Circuit is open, requests fail fast
- **Half-Open**: Testing if service is back

**Benefits**:
- Fault isolation
- Fast failure
- Automatic recovery
- Resource protection

**Drawbacks**:
- Configuration complexity
- False positives
- Monitoring requirements
- State management

#### 2. Bulkhead Pattern
**Intent**: Isolate resources to prevent failures in one area from affecting others.

**Problem**: Resource contention can cause failures to cascade across different parts of the system.

**Solution**: Partition resources into isolated groups (bulkheads) so that failures in one group don't affect others.

**Types**:
- **Thread Pool Isolation**: Separate thread pools
- **Connection Pool Isolation**: Separate connection pools
- **Service Instance Isolation**: Separate service instances

**Benefits**:
- Fault isolation
- Resource protection
- Performance isolation
- Graceful degradation

**Drawbacks**:
- Resource overhead
- Configuration complexity
- Monitoring complexity
- Operational overhead

## Anti-Patterns

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### 1. Distributed Monolith

**Symptoms**:
- Services share databases
- Services communicate synchronously
- Services must be deployed together
- Changes require coordination across services

**Solution**: Apply proper decomposition patterns and use asynchronous communication.

#### 2. Database per Service Anti-Pattern
**Problem**: Sharing databases between services.

**Symptoms**:
- Multiple services access the same database
- Database changes affect multiple services
- Services are tightly coupled through data
- Difficult to scale services independently

**Solution**: Implement proper data isolation and use events for data synchronization.

#### 3. Chatty Services
**Problem**: Services make too many small requests to each other.

- Increased complexity

**Solution**: Use batch operations, caching, and event-driven communication.

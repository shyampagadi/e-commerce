### Task 4: Monitoring and Observability

**Objective**: Implement monitoring and observability on AWS.

**Instructions**:
1. Configure CloudWatch for metrics and logging
2. Set up X-Ray for distributed tracing
3. Design custom dashboards and alerts
4. Plan for log aggregation and analysis
5. Design for incident response

**Deliverables**:
- CloudWatch configuration
- X-Ray setup
- Dashboard and alerting design
- Log aggregation plan
- Incident response procedures

## Extensions

### Advanced Challenge 1: Multi-Region Deployment
Design infrastructure for global multi-region deployment with data replication.

### Advanced Challenge 2: Serverless Architecture
Design serverless microservices using AWS Lambda and related services.

### Advanced Challenge 3: Cost Optimization
Design cost-optimized infrastructure with reserved instances and spot instances.

## Solution Guidelines

### Infrastructure Design Example
```
VPC Architecture:
- Public Subnets: Load balancers, NAT gateways
- Private Subnets: Application servers, databases
- Database Subnets: RDS instances, ElastiCache
- Multi-AZ: Deploy across 3 availability zones
- Security Groups: Restrictive access rules
```

### Container Orchestration Example
```
ECS Cluster:
- Fargate: Serverless container platform
- Auto Scaling: Based on CPU and memory
- Service Discovery: AWS Cloud Map
- Load Balancing: Application Load Balancer
- Monitoring: CloudWatch and X-Ray
```

### Database and Storage Example
```
Database Strategy:
- RDS PostgreSQL: User data, content metadata
- DynamoDB: Real-time data, sessions
- ElastiCache Redis: Caching layer
- S3: File storage, backups
- CloudFront: CDN for global content
```

### Monitoring Example
```
CloudWatch Setup:
- Custom metrics for business KPIs
- Log groups for each service
- Alarms for critical thresholds
- Dashboards for different teams
- Automated responses to alerts
```

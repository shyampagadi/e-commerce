# Exercise 1: Microservice Design Principles

## Learning Objectives

After completing this exercise, you will be able to:
- Apply microservice design principles to real-world scenarios
- Identify appropriate service boundaries
- Design services with proper cohesion and coupling
- Implement fault tolerance patterns
- Apply scalability principles

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of microservices concepts
- Basic knowledge of system design
- Familiarity with distributed systems challenges
- Access to diagramming tools (Lucidchart, Draw.io, or similar)

## Scenario

You are tasked with designing a microservices architecture for a large e-commerce platform that needs to handle:
- 1 million daily active users
- 10,000 concurrent transactions
- 99.9% availability
- Global distribution across 3 regions
- Integration with 15+ external payment providers
- Real-time inventory management
- Complex order processing workflows

## Tasks

### Task 1: Service Identification

**Objective**: Identify the core services needed for the e-commerce platform.

**Instructions**:
1. Analyze the business requirements and identify 8-12 core services
2. For each service, define:
   - Primary responsibility
   - Key business capabilities
   - Data ownership
   - Team ownership
3. Create a service dependency diagram showing relationships between services

**Deliverables**:
- List of identified services with descriptions
- Service dependency diagram
- Justification for service boundaries

### Task 2: Cohesion and Coupling Analysis

**Objective**: Ensure each service has high cohesion and low coupling.

**Instructions**:
1. For each identified service, analyze:
   - Internal cohesion (what keeps the service together)
   - External coupling (dependencies on other services)
2. Identify any services that might have low cohesion or high coupling
3. Propose refactoring strategies for problematic services
4. Create a coupling matrix showing service dependencies

**Deliverables**:
- Cohesion analysis for each service
- Coupling analysis and dependency matrix
- Refactoring recommendations

### Task 3: Fault Tolerance Design

**Objective**: Design fault tolerance mechanisms for the microservices.

**Instructions**:
1. Identify potential failure points in your architecture
2. Design circuit breaker patterns for critical service calls
3. Implement bulkhead patterns to isolate failures
4. Design retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
5. Plan for graceful degradation scenarios

**Deliverables**:
- Failure point analysis
- Circuit breaker configuration
- Bulkhead isolation strategy
- Retry and timeout policies
- Graceful degradation plan

### Task 4: Scalability Planning

**Objective**: Design for horizontal and vertical scalability.

**Instructions**:
1. Identify services that will need to scale independently
2. Design stateless service patterns
3. Plan for database scaling strategies
4. Design caching layers for performance
5. Plan for load balancing and traffic distribution

**Deliverables**:
- Scalability analysis for each service
- Stateless design patterns
- Database scaling strategy
- Caching architecture
- Load balancing configuration

## Extensions

### Advanced Challenge 1: Multi-Tenant Design
Design the architecture to support multiple tenants with data isolation and custom configurations.

### Advanced Challenge 2: Event-Driven Architecture
Convert the synchronous communication patterns to event-driven patterns using domain events.

### Advanced Challenge 3: Performance Optimization
Design for sub-100ms response times for critical user-facing operations.

## Solution Guidelines

### Service Identification Example
```
Core Services:
1. User Service - User management, authentication, profiles
2. Product Service - Product catalog, inventory, pricing
3. Order Service - Order processing, payment, fulfillment
4. Payment Service - Payment processing, gateway integration
5. Inventory Service - Real-time inventory management
6. Notification Service - Email, SMS, push notifications
7. Analytics Service - Data collection, reporting, insights
8. Search Service - Product search, recommendations
```

### Cohesion Analysis Example
```
User Service Cohesion:
- High: All functions relate to user management
- Clear boundaries: Authentication, profiles, preferences
- Single responsibility: User lifecycle management
- Data ownership: User data, authentication tokens
```

### Fault Tolerance Example
```
Circuit Breaker Configuration:
- Failure threshold: 5 failures in 60 seconds
- Timeout: 30 seconds
- Retry attempts: 3 with exponential backoff
- Fallback: Cached user data or error page
```

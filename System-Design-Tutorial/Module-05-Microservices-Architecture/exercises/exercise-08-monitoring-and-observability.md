## Solution Guidelines

### Monitoring Strategy Example
```
Key Metrics:
- Business: Trade volume, P&L, risk exposure
- Technical: Latency, throughput, error rate
- Infrastructure: CPU, memory, network, disk
- Application: Response time, queue depth, cache hit rate

Collection Strategy:
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Custom dashboards for trading floor
- Real-time alerts for critical metrics
```

### Distributed Tracing Example
```
Tracing Strategy:
- Trace all trading workflows
- Include external API calls
- Capture timing and performance data
- Store traces for 30 days
- Use correlation IDs for request tracking

Tools:
- Jaeger for distributed tracing
- OpenTelemetry for instrumentation
- Custom dashboards for trace analysis
- Automated trace analysis for anomalies
```

### Centralized Logging Example
```
Log Collection:
- ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Structured JSON logging
- Log aggregation from all services
- Real-time log streaming
- Log search and analysis tools

Security:
- Audit logs for all trading activities
- Compliance logging for regulations
- Log encryption and retention
- Access control and monitoring
```

### Health Checks Example
```
Health Check Endpoints:
- /health - Basic service health
- /ready - Service readiness
- /live - Service liveness
- /metrics - Prometheus metrics
- /status - Detailed service status

Alerting Rules:
- Error rate > 0.1%
- Latency > 10ms
- CPU usage > 80%
- Memory usage > 85%
- Disk usage > 90%
```

# Exercise 6: Data Management Patterns

## Learning Objectives

After completing this exercise, you will be able to:
- Implement Database per Service pattern
- Design CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) systems
- Apply Event Sourcing for audit trails and state reconstruction
- Implement Saga patterns for distributed transactions
- Plan for data consistency and synchronization

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of microservices data challenges
- Knowledge of database design and ACID properties
- Familiarity with event-driven architecture
- Access to database and messaging tools

## Scenario

You are designing the data management layer for a comprehensive supply chain management system that needs to handle:
- Product catalog and inventory management
- Order processing and fulfillment
- Supplier and vendor management
- Warehouse and logistics operations
- Financial transactions and billing
- Compliance and audit requirements
- Real-time tracking and notifications
- Integration with external systems

## Tasks

### Task 1: Database per Service Design

**Objective**: Design database per service architecture for the supply chain system.

**Instructions**:
1. Identify data ownership for each microservice
2. Choose appropriate databases for each service
3. Design data schemas and relationships
4. Plan for data isolation and independence
5. Design data access patterns and APIs

**Deliverables**:
- Data ownership mapping
- Database selection for each service
- Schema designs
- Data isolation strategy
- Data access patterns

### Task 2: CQRS Implementation

**Objective**: Implement CQRS pattern for complex read and write operations.

**Instructions**:
1. Identify services that need CQRS
2. Design command and query models
3. Plan for data synchronization between models
4. Design event handling for model updates
5. Plan for read model optimization

**Deliverables**:
- CQRS service identification
- Command and query model designs
- Data synchronization strategy
- Event handling design
- Read model optimization plan

### Task 3: Event Sourcing Design

**Objective**: Design event sourcing for audit trails and state reconstruction.

**Instructions**:
1. Identify services that need event sourcing
2. Design domain events and event schemas
3. Plan for event storage and retrieval
4. Design event replay and state reconstruction
5. Plan for event versioning and migration

**Deliverables**:
- Event sourcing service identification
- Domain event designs
- Event storage strategy
- Event replay design
- Versioning and migration plan

### Task 4: Saga Pattern Implementation

**Objective**: Implement Saga patterns for distributed transactions.

**Instructions**:
1. Identify business processes that need distributed transactions
2. Choose between choreography and orchestration sagas
3. Design saga steps and compensating actions
4. Plan for saga failure handling and recovery
5. Design for saga monitoring and debugging

**Deliverables**:
- Saga process identification
- Choreography vs orchestration decisions
- Saga step designs
- Compensating action plans
- Failure handling strategy

## Extensions

### Advanced Challenge 1: Multi-tenant Data

### Advanced Challenge 2: Real-time Analytics
Design for real-time analytics and reporting across distributed data.

### Advanced Challenge 3: Global Distribution
Design for global data distribution with data residency requirements.

## Solution Guidelines

### Database per Service Example
```
Service Databases:
- Product Service: PostgreSQL (relational data)
- Inventory Service: MongoDB (document-based)
- Order Service: PostgreSQL (ACID transactions)
- Analytics Service: ClickHouse (analytical queries)
- Cache Service: Redis (fast access)
```

### CQRS Example
```
Order Service CQRS:
- Command Model: Order creation, updates, cancellations
- Query Model: Order history, status, analytics
- Events: OrderCreated, OrderUpdated, OrderCancelled
- Synchronization: Event-driven updates
```

### Event Sourcing Example
```
Inventory Service Events:
- InventoryReserved
- InventoryReleased
- InventoryAdjusted
- InventoryTransferred
- InventoryAudited
```

### Saga Pattern Example
```
Order Fulfillment Saga:
1. Reserve Inventory
2. Process Payment
3. Create Shipment
4. Update Order Status
5. Send Notification

Compensating Actions:
- Release Inventory
- Refund Payment
- Cancel Shipment
- Revert Order Status
- Send Cancellation
```

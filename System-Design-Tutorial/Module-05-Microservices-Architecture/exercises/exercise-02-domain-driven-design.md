# Exercise 2: Domain-Driven Design

## Learning Objectives

After completing this exercise, you will be able to:
- Apply Domain-Driven Design principles to identify service boundaries
- Create bounded contexts for complex business domains
- Use ubiquitous language to improve communication
- Implement context mapping strategies
- Apply event storming techniques for domain modeling

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of microservices concepts
- Basic knowledge of Domain-Driven Design
- Familiarity with business domain modeling
- Access to diagramming tools (Lucidchart, Draw.io, or similar)

## Scenario

You are tasked with designing a microservices architecture for a comprehensive healthcare management system that needs to handle:
- Patient management and medical records
- Appointment scheduling and management
- Billing and insurance processing
- Pharmacy and medication management
- Laboratory and diagnostic services
- Telemedicine and remote consultations
- Compliance with HIPAA regulations
- Integration with external healthcare systems

## Tasks

### Task 1: Domain Analysis

**Objective**: Analyze the healthcare domain and identify core business domains.

**Instructions**:
1. Identify 6-8 core business domains in the healthcare system
2. For each domain, define:
   - Core business concepts and entities
   - Key business processes and workflows
   - Data ownership and responsibilities
   - External dependencies and integrations
3. Create a domain map showing relationships between domains
4. Identify potential bounded contexts for each domain

**Deliverables**:
- List of identified business domains with descriptions
- Domain map showing relationships
- Bounded context definitions
- Justification for domain boundaries

### Task 2: Ubiquitous Language Development

**Objective**: Develop a ubiquitous language for the healthcare domain.

**Instructions**:
1. For each identified domain, create a glossary of terms
2. Define key business concepts and their relationships
3. Identify terms that have different meanings in different contexts
4. Create a shared vocabulary that all stakeholders can understand
5. Document business rules and constraints using the ubiquitous language

**Deliverables**:
- Domain glossary for each bounded context
- Business concept definitions
- Context-specific terminology
- Business rules documentation

### Task 3: Context Mapping

**Objective**: Create a context map showing relationships between bounded contexts.

**Instructions**:
1. Identify relationships between bounded contexts
2. Map out integration patterns (Shared Kernel, Customer-Supplier, etc.)
3. Design anti-corruption layers where needed
4. Plan for data synchronization between contexts
5. Identify shared services and common functionality

**Deliverables**:
- Context map diagram
- Integration pattern definitions
- Anti-corruption layer designs
- Data synchronization strategy

### Task 4: Event Storming

**Objective**: Use event storming to model the healthcare system.

**Instructions**:
1. Conduct an event storming session for the patient journey
2. Identify domain events, commands, and aggregates
3. Map out the complete patient workflow
4. Identify cross-domain events and interactions
5. Design event-driven communication patterns

**Deliverables**:
- Event storming session results
- Domain event definitions
- Command and aggregate models
- Event-driven architecture design

## Extensions

### Advanced Challenge 1: Multi-Tenant Healthcare
Design the system to support multiple healthcare providers with data isolation and custom configurations.

### Advanced Challenge 2: Real-time Integration
Design real-time integration with external healthcare systems and medical devices.

### Advanced Challenge 3: Compliance and Security
Design for HIPAA compliance and advanced security requirements.

## Solution Guidelines

### Domain Analysis Example
```
Core Business Domains:
1. Patient Management - Patient registration, profiles, medical history
2. Appointment Management - Scheduling, rescheduling, cancellations
3. Medical Records - Clinical notes, diagnoses, treatments
4. Billing Management - Invoicing, payments, insurance claims
5. Pharmacy Management - Medication management, prescriptions
6. Laboratory Services - Test orders, results, reporting
7. Telemedicine - Remote consultations, video calls
8. Compliance - HIPAA compliance, audit trails
```

### Ubiquitous Language Example
```
Patient Management Domain:
- Patient: Individual receiving healthcare services
- Medical Record: Complete health history of a patient
- Provider: Healthcare professional providing services
- Appointment: Scheduled meeting between patient and provider
- Diagnosis: Medical determination of a condition
- Treatment: Medical intervention for a condition
```

### Context Mapping Example
```
Integration Patterns:
- Patient Management ↔ Medical Records: Shared Kernel
- Appointment Management → Billing Management: Customer-Supplier
- Laboratory Services → Medical Records: Anti-Corruption Layer
- External Systems → All Domains: Open Host Service
```

### Event Storming Example
```
Patient Journey Events:
- PatientRegistered
- AppointmentScheduled
- AppointmentCompleted
- DiagnosisRecorded
- TreatmentPrescribed
- BillingGenerated
- PaymentProcessed
```

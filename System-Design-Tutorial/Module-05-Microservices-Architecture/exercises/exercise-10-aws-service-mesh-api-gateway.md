## Solution Guidelines

### Service Mesh Example
```
App Mesh Configuration:
- Virtual Services: Device management, data processing
- Virtual Nodes: ECS tasks and Lambda functions
- Virtual Routers: Traffic routing and load balancing
- Routes: Path-based and header-based routing
- Circuit Breaker: Failure detection and recovery
```

### API Gateway Example
```
API Gateway Setup:
- REST APIs: Device management, data access
- HTTP APIs: Real-time data streaming
- WebSocket APIs: Real-time device communication
- Custom Authorizers: JWT and API key validation
- Usage Plans: Rate limiting and throttling
```

### Service Discovery Example
```
Cloud Map Configuration:
- Namespaces: iot-platform.local
- Services: device-service, data-service, analytics-service
- Health Checks: HTTP and TCP health checks
- DNS Resolution: Service discovery via DNS
- Load Balancing: Weighted and round-robin
```

### Security Example
```
Security Configuration:
- mTLS: Mutual TLS for service communication
- API Keys: Simple authentication for APIs
- JWT Tokens: Stateless authentication
- IAM Roles: Fine-grained access control
- VPC Endpoints: Secure AWS service access
```

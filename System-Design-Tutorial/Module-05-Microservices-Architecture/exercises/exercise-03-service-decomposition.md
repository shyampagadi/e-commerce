# Exercise 3: Service Decomposition

## Learning Objectives

After completing this exercise, you will be able to:
- Apply different service decomposition strategies
- Identify appropriate service boundaries
- Design service decomposition for legacy systems
- Implement the Strangler Fig pattern
- Plan data migration strategies

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of microservices concepts
- Knowledge of Domain-Driven Design
- Familiarity with legacy system migration
- Access to diagramming tools

## Scenario

You are tasked with decomposing a monolithic banking system into microservices. The current system handles:
- Customer account management
- Transaction processing
- Loan management
- Credit card services
- Investment portfolio management
- Risk assessment and compliance
- Reporting and analytics
- Integration with external financial systems

## Tasks

### Task 1: Decomposition Strategy Selection

**Objective**: Choose the appropriate decomposition strategy for the banking system.

**Instructions**:
1. Analyze the current monolithic system
2. Evaluate different decomposition strategies:
   - Decompose by Business Capability
   - Decompose by Domain (DDD)
   - Decompose by Data
   - Decompose by Team
3. Select the best strategy with justification
4. Create a decomposition plan

**Deliverables**:
- Analysis of current system
- Evaluation of decomposition strategies
- Selected strategy with justification
- Decomposition plan

### Task 2: Service Boundary Definition

**Objective**: Define clear boundaries for each microservice.

**Instructions**:
1. Identify 8-10 microservices for the banking system
2. For each service, define:
   - Primary responsibility
   - Data ownership
   - API boundaries
   - Dependencies
3. Create a service dependency diagram
4. Validate service boundaries

**Deliverables**:
- List of identified services
- Service boundary definitions
- Service dependency diagram
- Boundary validation

### Task 3: Strangler Fig Implementation

**Objective**: Design a migration strategy using the Strangler Fig pattern.

**Instructions**:
1. Select the first service to extract
2. Design the extraction process
3. Plan data migration strategy
4. Design the facade layer
5. Create migration timeline

**Deliverables**:
- Service extraction plan
- Data migration strategy
- Facade design
- Migration timeline

### Task 4: Data Management Strategy

**Objective**: Design data management for the decomposed system.

**Instructions**:
1. Plan database per service implementation
2. Design data synchronization strategies
3. Plan for distributed transactions
4. Design data migration approach
5. Plan for data consistency

**Deliverables**:
- Database per service plan
- Data synchronization strategy
- Distributed transaction approach
- Data migration plan
- Consistency strategy

## Extensions

### Advanced Challenge 1: Real-time Processing
Design for real-time transaction processing with sub-second response times.

### Advanced Challenge 2: Global Distribution
Design for global distribution with data residency requirements.

### Advanced Challenge 3: Regulatory Compliance
Design for strict regulatory compliance and audit requirements.

## Solution Guidelines

### Service Identification Example
```
Banking Microservices:
1. Customer Service - Customer management and profiles
2. Account Service - Account management and balances
3. Transaction Service - Transaction processing and history
4. Loan Service - Loan management and processing
5. Credit Card Service - Credit card operations
6. Investment Service - Portfolio management
7. Risk Service - Risk assessment and compliance
8. Reporting Service - Analytics and reporting
9. Notification Service - Customer communications
10. Integration Service - External system integration
```

### Decomposition Strategy Example
```
Selected Strategy: Decompose by Business Capability
Rationale:
- Clear business alignment
- Independent business functions
- Team autonomy
- Regulatory compliance requirements
```

### Strangler Fig Example
```
First Service to Extract: Customer Service
Rationale:
- Clear boundaries
- Limited dependencies
- High business value
- Low risk
```

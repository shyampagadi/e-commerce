4. Plan for analytics and monitoring
5. Design for flag lifecycle management

**Deliverables**:
- Feature flag architecture
- Configuration management
- User targeting design
- Analytics and monitoring
- Lifecycle management

## Extensions

### Advanced Challenge 1: Multi-Region Deployment

### Advanced Challenge 3: Compliance and Security

## Solution Guidelines

### Blue/Green Deployment Example
```
Infrastructure:
- Blue Environment: Current production
- Green Environment: New version
- Load Balancer: Traffic switching
- Database: Shared with replication
- Monitoring: Health checks and metrics

Process:
1. Deploy to Green environment
2. Run health checks and tests
3. Switch traffic to Green
4. Monitor for issues
5. Decommission Blue if successful
```

### Canary Deployment Example
```
Traffic Splitting:
- 5% to Canary (new version)
- 95% to Stable (current version)
- Gradual increase: 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%
- Automatic rollback on error threshold

Monitoring:
- Error rate < 1%
- Response time < 200ms
- CPU usage < 80%
- Memory usage < 85%
```

### Rolling Deployment Example
```
Process:
1. Update 1 instance at a time
2. Wait for health check
3. Update next instance
4. Continue until all updated
5. Monitor overall health

Health Checks:
- HTTP endpoint checks
- Database connectivity
- External service calls
- Performance metrics
```

### Feature Flag Example
```
Flag Types:
- Boolean flags: Simple on/off
- Percentage flags: Gradual rollout
- User targeting: Specific user groups
- A/B testing: Experiment variants

Management:
- Centralized configuration
- Real-time updates
- User segmentation
- Analytics tracking
```

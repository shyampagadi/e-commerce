# Data Management Patterns

## Overview

Data management in microservices architecture presents unique challenges due to the distributed nature of services. This document covers various patterns and strategies for managing data across microservices, including database per service, CQRS, event sourcing, and saga patterns.

## Core Data Management Principles

### 1. Database per Service

Each microservice should have its own database, ensuring data ownership and independence.

#### Characteristics
- **Data Ownership**: Each service owns its data completely
- **Technology Independence**: Services can use different database technologies
- **Independent Evolution**: Database schemas can evolve independently
- **Data Isolation**: Services cannot directly access other services' data

#### Implementation Considerations
- **Data Consistency**: Maintaining consistency across services
- **Distributed Transactions**: Handling transactions across services
- **Data Synchronization**: Keeping data synchronized
- **Query Complexity**: Complex queries across services

#### Benefits
- **Data Isolation**: Clear data boundaries
- **Technology Diversity**: Use appropriate database for each service
- **Independent Scaling**: Scale databases independently
- **Reduced Coupling**: Services are less coupled

#### Challenges
- **Data Consistency**: Maintaining consistency across services
- **Distributed Transactions**: Handling transactions across services
- **Data Synchronization**: Keeping data synchronized
- **Query Complexity**: Complex queries across services

### 2. Shared Database Anti-Pattern

Avoid sharing databases between services as it creates tight coupling.

#### Problems with Shared Database
- **Tight Coupling**: Services are tightly coupled
- **Schema Changes**: Changes affect multiple services
- **Scaling Issues**: Difficult to scale independently
- **Technology Lock-in**: All services must use same database

#### Why It's Problematic
- **Tight Coupling**: Services are tightly coupled
- **Schema Changes**: Changes affect multiple services
- **Scaling Issues**: Difficult to scale independently
- **Technology Lock-in**: All services must use same database

## CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

CQRS separates read and write operations, allowing different models for commands and queries.

### 1. CQRS Architecture

#### Command Side (Write Model)
The command side handles write operations and business logic:
- **Command Handlers**: Process commands and execute business logic
- **Aggregates**: Encapsulate business rules and invariants
- **Event Store**: Store events for audit and replay
- **Write Database**: Optimized for write operations
- **Validation**: Ensure data integrity and business rules

#### Query Side (Read Model)
The query side handles read operations and data presentation:
- **Query Handlers**: Process queries and return data
- **Read Models**: Optimized for specific query patterns
- **Read Database**: Optimized for read operations
- **Projections**: Transform events into read models
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data

#### Benefits
- **Performance**: Optimize read and write operations separately
- **Scalability**: Scale read and write sides independently
- **Flexibility**: Use different technologies for read and write
- **Complexity**: Handle complex query requirements
- **Consistency**: Maintain eventual consistency

### 2. Event Sourcing

Event sourcing stores events instead of current state, providing a complete audit trail.

#### Event Store
The event store is the single source of truth for all events:
- **Event Storage**: Store events in chronological order
- **Event Retrieval**: Retrieve events by aggregate ID
- **Event Replay**: Replay events to reconstruct state
- **Event Versioning**: Handle event schema evolution
- **Event Persistence**: Ensure event durability

#### Aggregate Reconstruction
Aggregates are reconstructed by replaying events:
- **Event Application**: Apply events to reconstruct state
- **State Validation**: Validate state after event application
- **Event Ordering**: Ensure events are applied in correct order
- **Snapshot Optimization**: Use snapshots for performance
- **Event Projection**: Project events to read models

#### Benefits
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all changes
- **Event Replay**: Replay events for debugging and analysis
- **Temporal Queries**: Query data at any point in time
- **Event Sourcing**: Use events as the source of truth
- **Scalability**: Scale event processing independently

## Saga Pattern

The Saga pattern manages distributed transactions across multiple services.

### 1. Choreography-Based Saga

In choreography-based sagas, each service knows what to do when it receives an event.

#### Implementation
- **Event Publishing**: Services publish events when actions complete
- **Event Subscribing**: Services subscribe to relevant events
- **Event Handling**: Services handle events and perform actions
- **Compensation**: Services handle compensation when failures occur
- **Event Ordering**: Ensure events are processed in correct order

#### Benefits
- **Loose Coupling**: Services are loosely coupled
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new services
- **Flexibility**: Services can be added or removed easily
- **Resilience**: Failures are isolated to individual services
- **Simplicity**: Simple to understand and implement

#### Drawbacks
- **Complexity**: Can become complex with many services
- **Debugging**: Harder to debug distributed workflows
- **Event Ordering**: Challenges with event ordering
- **Compensation**: Complex compensation logic

### 2. Orchestration-Based Saga

In orchestration-based sagas, a central orchestrator coordinates the saga steps.

#### Implementation
- **Saga Orchestrator**: Central coordinator for the saga
- **Step Execution**: Execute saga steps in sequence
- **Compensation**: Handle compensation when steps fail
- **State Management**: Track saga state and progress
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors and retries

#### Benefits
- **Centralized Control**: Centralized workflow management
- **Easier Debugging**: Easier to debug and trace
- **State Management**: Centralized state management
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling
- **Monitoring**: Easier to monitor and observe

#### Drawbacks
- **Single Point of Failure**: Orchestrator can be a bottleneck
- **Tight Coupling**: Services are coupled to orchestrator
- **Scalability**: Orchestrator needs to scale
- **Complexity**: Orchestrator can become complex

## Data Consistency Strategies

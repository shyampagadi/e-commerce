# Domain-Driven Design

## Overview

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that focuses on creating software that reflects a deep understanding of the business domain. In microservices architecture, DDD provides a framework for identifying service boundaries and ensuring that services align with business capabilities.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Bounded Contexts

A bounded context is a logical boundary within which a particular domain model is defined and applicable.

#### Characteristics
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined limits of the context
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Consistent terminology within the context
- **Domain Model**: Complete model of the business domain
- **Team Ownership**: Owned by a specific team
- **Independent Evolution**: Can evolve independently

#### Example: E-commerce Platform
- **User Management Context**: User registration, authentication, profiles
- **Product Catalog Context**: Product information, categories, inventory
- **Order Processing Context**: Order creation, payment, fulfillment
- **Notification Context**: Email, SMS, push notifications

#### Benefits
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined service boundaries
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work independently
- **Domain Focus**: Focus on business domain
- **Reduced Complexity**: Simpler to understand and maintain
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale individual contexts

### 2. Domain Models

Domain models represent the core business concepts and their relationships.

#### Entity
An entity is an object that has a distinct identity that runs through time and different states.

#### Value Object
A value object is an object that is defined by its attributes rather than its identity.

#### Aggregate
An aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that are treated as a unit for data changes.

#### Domain Service
A domain service contains domain logic that doesn't naturally fit within an entity or value object.

#### Repository
A repository provides an abstraction for accessing domain objects.

#### Factory
A factory encapsulates the logic for creating complex objects and aggregates.

### 3. Ubiquitous Language

Ubiquitous language is a common language used by all team members to connect all activities of the team with the software.

#### Characteristics
- **Consistent Terminology**: Same terms used everywhere
- **Business Focus**: Terms reflect business concepts
- **Team Communication**: Facilitates communication
- **Code Integration**: Reflected in code
- **Documentation**: Used in documentation

#### Benefits
- **Clear Communication**: Reduces misunderstandings
- **Business Alignment**: Aligns technical and business teams
- **Code Clarity**: Makes code more readable
- **Documentation**: Improves documentation quality
- **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain and evolve

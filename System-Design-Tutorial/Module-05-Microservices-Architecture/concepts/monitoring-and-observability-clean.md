# Monitoring and Observability

## Overview

Monitoring and observability are critical for microservices architecture, providing insights into system health, performance, and behavior. This document covers various monitoring strategies, observability patterns, and best practices for microservices systems.

## Monitoring Pillars

### 1. Metrics

Metrics are numerical measurements that provide insights into system behavior over time.

#### Types of Metrics
- **Counter**: Monotonically increasing values (requests, errors)
- **Gauge**: Values that can go up or down (memory usage, active connections)
- **Histogram**: Distribution of values (response times, request sizes)
- **Summary**: Quantiles and counts (percentiles, averages)

#### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network usage
- **Application Metrics**: Request rate, response time, error rate
- **Business Metrics**: User registrations, orders, revenue
- **Custom Metrics**: Domain-specific measurements

#### Benefits
- **Performance Insights**: Understand system performance
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify trends and patterns
- **Alerting**: Trigger alerts based on thresholds
- **Capacity Planning**: Plan for future capacity needs

### 2. Logging

Logging provides detailed information about system events and behavior.

#### Log Levels
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for debugging
- **INFO**: General information about system operation
- **WARN**: Warning messages for potential issues
- **ERROR**: Error messages for failures
- **FATAL**: Critical errors that cause system shutdown

#### Structured Logging

### 3. Tracing

Distributed tracing tracks requests across multiple services in a microservices architecture.

#### Trace Components
- **Trace**: Complete request journey across services
- **Span**: Individual operation within a trace
- **Context**: Information passed between services
- **Tags**: Metadata about spans

#### Trace Lifecycle
1. **Start Trace**: Create root span for incoming request
2. **Propagate Context**: Pass trace context to downstream services
3. **Create Spans**: Create spans for each service operation
4. **Add Metadata**: Add tags and logs to spans
5. **Complete Spans**: Mark spans as completed
6. **Send to Collector**: Send traces to tracing system

#### Benefits
- **Request Tracking**: Track requests across services
- **Performance Analysis**: Identify performance bottlenecks
- **Error Tracking**: Track errors across service boundaries
- **Dependency Mapping**: Understand service dependencies

## Health Checks

### 1. Liveness Probes

Liveness probes determine if a service is running and responsive.

#### Implementation

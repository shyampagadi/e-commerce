# Deployment Strategies

## Overview

Deployment strategies are crucial for microservices architecture as they determine how services are deployed, updated, and managed in production environments. This document covers various deployment strategies, including blue/green, canary, rolling, and feature flag deployments.

## Deployment Strategy Types

### 1. Blue/Green Deployment

Blue/Green deployment maintains two identical production environments, switching traffic between them.

#### Characteristics
- **Two Environments**: Blue (current) and Green (new)
- **Instant Switch**: Traffic switches instantly between environments
- **Zero Downtime**: No downtime during deployment
- **Quick Rollback**: Fast rollback by switching back to blue

#### Implementation Process
1. **Deploy to Green**: Deploy new version to green environment
2. **Health Checks**: Run health checks on green environment
3. **Smoke Tests**: Run smoke tests on green environment
4. **Switch Traffic**: Switch traffic to green environment
5. **Monitor**: Monitor green environment for issues
6. **Decommission Blue**: Decommission blue environment if successful

#### Benefits
- **Zero Downtime**: No downtime during deployment
- **Quick Rollback**: Fast rollback capability
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces deployment risk
- **Testing**: Can test new version before switching

#### Drawbacks
- **Resource Usage**: Requires double the resources
- **Cost**: Higher infrastructure costs
- **Complexity**: More complex setup and management
- **Data Synchronization**: Need to keep data synchronized

### 2. Canary Deployment

Canary deployment gradually rolls out new versions to a small subset of users.

#### Characteristics
- **Gradual Rollout**: Slowly increase traffic to new version
- **Risk Mitigation**: Limited impact if issues occur
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor metrics during rollout
- **Automatic Rollback**: Can automatically rollback if issues detected

#### Implementation Process
1. **Deploy to Canary**: Deploy new version to canary environment
2. **Gradual Increase**: Gradually increase traffic percentage
3. **Monitor Metrics**: Monitor key metrics during rollout
4. **Check Thresholds**: Check if metrics exceed thresholds
5. **Complete or Rollback**: Complete deployment or rollback based on metrics

#### Benefits
- **Risk Mitigation**: Limited impact if issues occur
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor metrics during rollout
- **Gradual Rollout**: Smooth transition to new version
- **Automatic Rollback**: Can automatically rollback

#### Drawbacks
- **Complexity**: More complex monitoring and management
- **Time**: Takes longer to complete deployment
- **Monitoring**: Requires sophisticated monitoring
- **Configuration**: Complex configuration management

### 3. Rolling Deployment

Rolling deployment updates instances one by one, maintaining service availability.

#### Characteristics
- **Incremental Updates**: Updates instances one by one
- **Service Availability**: Maintains service availability
- **Resource Efficient**: Uses existing resources
- **Gradual Rollout**: Smooth transition to new version

#### Implementation Process
1. **Get Instances**: Get current service instances
2. **Update Instance**: Update one instance at a time
3. **Health Check**: Wait for instance to be healthy
4. **Add to Load Balancer**: Add instance back to load balancer
5. **Wait**: Wait between deployments
6. **Verify**: Verify deployment success

#### Benefits
- **Service Availability**: Maintains service availability
- **Resource Efficient**: Uses existing resources
- **Simple**: Relatively simple to implement
- **Gradual**: Smooth transition to new version

#### Drawbacks
- **Time**: Takes longer to complete deployment
- **Complexity**: Complex rollback process
- **Monitoring**: Requires careful monitoring
- **Configuration**: Complex configuration management

### 4. Feature Flag Deployment

Feature flags allow enabling/disabling features without code deployment.

#### Characteristics
- **Runtime Control**: Control features at runtime
- **A/B Testing**: Enable A/B testing
- **Gradual Rollout**: Gradually enable features
- **Quick Rollback**: Quick feature disable

#### Implementation Process
1. **Deploy Code**: Deploy code with feature flags
2. **Configure Flags**: Configure feature flags
3. **Enable Gradually**: Gradually enable features
4. **Monitor**: Monitor feature performance
5. **Complete or Disable**: Complete rollout or disable features

#### Benefits
- **Runtime Control**: Control features at runtime
- **A/B Testing**: Enable A/B testing
- **Quick Rollback**: Quick feature disable
- **Gradual Rollout**: Gradually enable features

#### Drawbacks
- **Complexity**: More complex code
- **Technical Debt**: Can accumulate technical debt
- **Testing**: More complex testing
- **Management**: Requires feature flag management

## Container Orchestration

- **Service Discovery**: Built-in service discovery
- **Health Monitoring**: Health monitoring and restart

#### Ingress Configuration
- **External Access**: External access to services
- **Load Balancing**: Load balancing across services
- **SSL Termination**: SSL termination
- **Path Routing**: Route based on URL paths

### 2. Docker Compose Deployment

Docker Compose provides simple multi-container deployment.

#### Configuration
- **Service Definitions**: Define all services
- **Networking**: Configure service networking
- **Volumes**: Configure data persistence
- **Environment**: Configure environment variables
- **Dependencies**: Define service dependencies

## Deployment Automation

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline

Automated deployment pipeline for microservices.

#### Pipeline Stages
1. **Code Checkout**: Checkout source code
2. **Build**: Build application and container images
3. **Test**: Run unit and integration tests
4. **Security Scan**: Scan for security vulnerabilities
5. **Deploy to Staging**: Deploy to staging environment
6. **Integration Tests**: Run integration tests
7. **Deploy to Production**: Deploy to production environment

#### Benefits
- **Automation**: Automated deployment process
- **Consistency**: Consistent deployment process
- **Quality**: Automated quality checks
- **Speed**: Faster deployment cycles

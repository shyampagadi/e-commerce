- **Solution Code** → **Design Solutions with Business Justification**

### ENHANCE with Strategic Content
- Business alignment analysis
- Trade-off evaluation frameworks
- Stakeholder impact assessment
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Long-term architectural evolution planning

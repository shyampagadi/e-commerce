**Type**: Network Security Crisis Leadership | **Duration**: 6 hours | **Difficulty**: Master

### Scenario Setup
You are Dr. Sarah Chen, Chief Information Security Officer at CyberBank, one of the world's largest investment banks with $2.5T in assets under management. It's 6:00 AM on Monday when your threat intelligence team detects sophisticated network intrusion indicators consistent with nation-state actors.

### Crisis Timeline and Escalation

#### Hour 0-1: Initial Detection
**Threat Intelligence Alert**:
- Advanced persistent threat (APT) signatures detected in network perimeter
- Command and control traffic to known nation-state infrastructure
- Lateral movement attempts across critical financial systems
- Estimated dwell time: 72 hours (attackers have been inside for 3 days)

**Immediate Stakeholders Demanding Answers**:
- **CEO Michael Rodriguez**: "How bad is this? Do we shut down trading?"
- **FBI Cyber Division**: "We need immediate access to investigate"
- **Federal Reserve**: "Any disruption to payment systems is unacceptable"
- **Board Chairman**: "$50B merger announcement is in 47 hours - can we proceed?"

#### Hour 1-2: Threat Assessment
**Technical Findings**:
- Attackers have compromised 15 network segments
- Access to customer transaction data (500M records at risk)
- Potential access to trading algorithms and market data
- Evidence of data exfiltration preparation but no confirmed theft

**Regulatory Pressure**:
- **SEC**: Demanding immediate disclosure assessment
- **CISA**: Requesting technical indicators for national threat intelligence
- **European Banking Authority**: Concerned about EU customer data
- **Bank of England**: Questioning UK subsidiary security

### Multi-Dimensional Crisis Challenges

#### Challenge 1: Technical Response Under Pressure
**Network Architecture Complexity**:
- 50 data centers across 25 countries
- Legacy mainframe systems with modern cloud integration
- Real-time trading systems requiring sub-millisecond latency
- Regulatory requirement for transaction audit trails

**Technical Decision Points**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate compromised segments (risks trading disruption)
2. **Forensic Preservation**: Maintain evidence integrity while continuing operations
3. **Threat Hunting**: Active search for additional compromise indicators
4. **System Hardening**: Emergency security patches during active incident

**Resource Constraints**:
- 24-person security team (8 currently available)
- $10M emergency response budget
- 4-hour window before Asian markets open
- FBI demanding exclusive access to compromised systems

#### Challenge 2: International Coordination Crisis
**Multi-Jurisdictional Complexity**:
- **United States**: FBI investigation with potential criminal charges
- **United Kingdom**: National Cyber Security Centre coordination
- **European Union**: GDPR breach notification requirements
- **Singapore**: Monetary Authority demanding local incident response
- **Japan**: Financial Services Agency requiring detailed reporting

**Conflicting Requirements**:
- US law enforcement wants to monitor attackers for intelligence gathering
- EU regulators demand immediate customer notification
- Asian regulators require local data forensics teams
- UK authorities want independent security assessment

#### Challenge 3: Business Continuity vs Security
**Financial Impact Calculations**:
- Trading system downtime: $50M per hour in lost revenue
- Customer confidence impact: Potential $500M in asset outflows
- Regulatory fines: Up to $2B for inadequate response
- Merger at risk: $50B transaction dependent on security assurance

**Stakeholder Pressure Matrix**:
- **Trading Desk**: "We can't stop trading - competitors will gain advantage"
- **Risk Management**: "We must shut down until we understand the scope"
- **Legal**: "Any action could create liability - we need careful documentation"
- **Public Relations**: "Media is already asking questions - we need a statement"

### Advanced Decision Scenarios

#### Decision Point 1: The Attribution Dilemma
**Intelligence Brief**: CIA provides classified briefing that attack is linked to foreign government attempting to manipulate merger announcement and destabilize financial markets.

**Options**:
1. **Cooperate Fully**: Share all technical data with intelligence agencies
2. **Limited Cooperation**: Provide minimum required information
3. **Independent Response**: Handle incident without government involvement
4. **Public Disclosure**: Reveal nation-state attribution to markets

**Stakeholder Positions**:
- **Government**: "National security requires full cooperation"
- **Board**: "We cannot be seen as tools of intelligence agencies"
- **Customers**: "We deserve to know who attacked our data"
- **International Partners**: "Attribution claims could damage diplomatic relations"

#### Decision Point 2: The Merger Announcement Crisis
**Situation**: 24 hours before merger announcement, forensics reveals attackers accessed merger documents and trading strategies.

**Implications**:
- Insider trading potential if information was used
- SEC investigation likely if merger proceeds
- Market manipulation if announcement is delayed
- Shareholder lawsuits regardless of decision

**Options**:
1. **Proceed with Announcement**: Risk regulatory investigation
2. **Delay Announcement**: Risk market speculation and competitor advantage
3. **Disclose Attack**: Risk market panic and merger collapse
4. **Modify Terms**: Adjust merger based on compromised information

#### Decision Point 3: The Customer Notification Dilemma
**Regulatory Requirements**:
- **GDPR**: 72-hour notification requirement (deadline approaching)
- **US Banking Regulations**: "Prompt" notification required
- **Asian Regulators**: Immediate disclosure to local authorities
- **SEC**: Material event disclosure requirements

**Customer Impact Assessment**:
- 500M customer records potentially accessed

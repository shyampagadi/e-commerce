**Your Challenge**: Redesign network architecture to maintain EU compliance, negotiate new provider relationships, manage massive infrastructure migration, and ensure zero business disruption during the transition.

### Part C: Network Transformation & Organizational Change
**Duration**: 2 weeks | **Focus**: Leading network modernization across complex organizations

#### Exercise 5: The Mega-Merger Network Integration
**Scenario**: Your company just completed a $100B merger creating the world's largest telecommunications provider. You must integrate three completely different network architectures while maintaining service for 500M customers across 40 countries.

**Integration Challenges**:
- **Company A**: Modern SDN architecture with cloud-native management
- **Company B**: Legacy MPLS network with proprietary protocols
- **Company C**: Hybrid architecture with significant technical debt
- Regulatory approval contingent on maintaining service quality
- $5B in promised synergies dependent on network integration
- 18-month timeline mandated by regulatory authorities

**Your Challenge**: Design and execute integration strategy that unifies three massive networks, achieves cost synergies, maintains regulatory compliance, and delivers promised shareholder value.

#### Exercise 6: The Zero Trust Transformation Under Attack
**Scenario**: As CISO at DefenseGlobal Corp, you're implementing zero trust architecture while under active attack from sophisticated adversaries targeting your network transformation process.

**Transformation Complexity**:
- 100,000 employees across 200 locations
- Legacy network with 20 years of accumulated complexity
- Active threats attempting to exploit transformation vulnerabilities
- Board mandate for completion within 12 months
- $500M budget with strict ROI requirements

**Your Challenge**: Lead zero trust implementation while defending against attackers who are specifically targeting your transformation process, manage organizational resistance to security changes, and deliver measurable security improvements.

### Part D: Advanced Network Strategy & Innovation
**Duration**: 2 weeks | **Focus**: Next-generation network leadership and strategic innovation

#### Exercise 7: The 5G Network Monetization Strategy
**Scenario**: You're Chief Strategy Officer at a major telecom provider tasked with developing a 5G network strategy that generates $10B in new revenue while competing against tech giants entering the telecom space.

**Strategic Challenges**:
- $50B 5G infrastructure investment requiring justification
- Amazon, Google, Microsoft entering telecom market
- Enterprise customers demanding network-as-a-service models

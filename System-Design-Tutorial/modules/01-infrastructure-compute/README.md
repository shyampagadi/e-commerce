**Duration**: 2 weeks | **Focus**: Executive-level infrastructure crisis management

#### Exercise 1: The GameStream Meltdown
**Scenario**: You're the newly appointed Head of Infrastructure at GameStream, a gaming platform experiencing explosive growth. During the biggest gaming tournament of the year, your infrastructure is failing catastrophically.

**Crisis Parameters**:
- 2.5M concurrent users (5x normal load)
- Revenue loss: $50K per minute of downtime
- Competitor offering affected streamers $100K signing bonuses
- Board meeting in 4 hours demanding explanations
- Engineering team split between immediate fixes vs long-term solutions

**Your Challenge**: Lead a war room session, make critical resource allocation decisions, and present a recovery strategy to the board while managing a panicked engineering team and furious business stakeholders.

#### Exercise 2: MegaCorp's Regulatory Nightmare
**Scenario**: As Chief Technology Officer at MegaCorp Financial, you discover your infrastructure doesn't comply with new financial regulations. You have 90 days to achieve compliance or face $50M in fines and potential business shutdown.

**Compliance Constraints**:
- Data residency requirements across 12 countries
- Audit trails for every transaction (5B+ daily)
- Zero-downtime migration requirements
- Budget frozen due to previous compliance failures
- Regulatory auditors arriving in 30 days

**Your Challenge**: Design a compliance strategy that satisfies regulators while maintaining business operations, all within existing budget constraints and aggressive timelines.

### Part B: Vendor Strategy & Negotiation Mastery
**Duration**: 2 weeks | **Focus**: Strategic vendor management and negotiation

#### Exercise 3: The Great Cloud Migration Negotiation
**Scenario**: You're leading GlobalTech Industries' $50M cloud migration. Three major cloud providers are competing for the contract, each offering different advantages and hidden costs.

**Negotiation Dynamics**:
- **Provider A**: 40% cost savings, but vendor lock-in concerns
- **Provider B**: Best technical fit, but 20% over budget
- **Provider C**: Hybrid approach, complex pricing model
- CFO demanding 30% cost reduction
- CTO insisting on technical excellence
- Legal concerned about data sovereignty

**Your Challenge**: Navigate a multi-stakeholder negotiation where technical, financial, and legal requirements conflict. Develop a negotiation strategy that satisfies all parties while securing the best long-term outcome.

#### Exercise 4: The Startup Scaling Dilemma
**Scenario**: As VP of Engineering at SocialWave (Series B startup), you must scale infrastructure to support 10x user growth in 6 months while operating under strict burn rate constraints.

**Scaling Pressures**:
- Current infrastructure costs: $50K/month
- Projected costs at 10x scale: $2M/month (unsustainable)
- Investor pressure to extend runway to 24 months
- Engineering team wants to rebuild everything
- Sales team promising features requiring massive compute

**Your Challenge**: Design a scaling strategy that balances growth ambitions with financial reality, while managing competing demands from investors, engineering, and sales teams.

### Part C: Organizational Transformation & Change Management
**Duration**: 2 weeks | **Focus**: Leading infrastructure transformation across organizations

#### Exercise 5: The Legacy Modernization Political Minefield
**Scenario**: You're tasked with modernizing TradCorp's 20-year-old infrastructure. The organization is deeply divided between modernization advocates and legacy system defenders.

**Political Landscape**:
- **Legacy Defenders**: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" - control 60% of budget
- **Modernization Advocates**: "We're falling behind competitors" - have CEO's ear
- **Operations Team**: Overworked, resistant to change, critical for day-to-day operations
- **Security Team**: Demanding immediate upgrades due to vulnerabilities
- **Finance Team**: Questioning ROI of modernization investments

**Your Challenge**: Build organizational consensus for modernization while addressing legitimate concerns from all stakeholders. Navigate office politics while maintaining technical integrity.

#### Exercise 6: The Acquisition Integration Challenge
**Scenario**: Your company just acquired three competitors with completely different infrastructure stacks. You have 12 months to integrate all systems while maintaining service levels for all customer bases.

**Integration Complexity**:
- **Company A**: Modern cloud-native, microservices architecture
- **Company B**: Traditional on-premises, monolithic applications
- **Company C**: Hybrid cloud, heavily customized solutions
- Combined customer base: 10M users with zero tolerance for service disruption
- Integration budget: $25M (50% less than initial estimates)
- Regulatory requirement to maintain separate data stores for 18 months

**Your Challenge**: Design and execute an integration strategy that unifies three disparate infrastructures while maintaining service quality and meeting regulatory requirements.

### Part D: Advanced Strategic Scenarios
**Duration**: 2 weeks | **Focus**: Complex multi-dimensional infrastructure challenges

#### Exercise 7: The Global Expansion Infrastructure Strategy
**Scenario**: As Global Head of Infrastructure, you must support expansion into 15 new countries, each with unique regulatory, technical, and cultural requirements.

**Expansion Challenges**:
- Data sovereignty laws varying by country
- Network latency requirements for real-time applications
- Local partnership requirements in 8 countries
- Currency fluctuation affecting infrastructure costs
- Talent acquisition challenges in emerging markets
- Geopolitical tensions affecting cloud provider availability

**Your Challenge**: Develop a global infrastructure strategy that balances standardization with localization, while managing geopolitical risks and regulatory compliance.

#### Exercise 8: The Sustainability Transformation
**Scenario**: The board has mandated carbon neutrality by 2025. As Head of Sustainable Infrastructure, you must reduce the company's infrastructure carbon footprint by 80% while supporting business growth.

**Sustainability Constraints**:
- Current infrastructure: 50,000 tons CO2/year
- Target: 10,000 tons CO2/year by 2025
- Business growth projection: 300% over 3 years
- Green energy premium: 40% higher costs

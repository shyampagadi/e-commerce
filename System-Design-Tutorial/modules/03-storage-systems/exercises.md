**Attack Profile**:
- Ransomware variant targeting healthcare data specifically
- 50PB of patient data encrypted across 200 data centers
- Critical systems offline: patient records, imaging, lab results
- Ransom demand: $100M Bitcoin with 72-hour deadline
- Threat to release patient data on dark web if payment refused

**Immediate Impact**:
- 15,000 hospitals unable to access patient records
- Emergency rooms switching to paper-based systems
- Cancer treatment schedules disrupted for 50,000 patients
- Surgical procedures postponed affecting 5,000 patients daily

#### Hour 2-6: Regulatory and Legal Cascade
**Multi-Jurisdictional Compliance Crisis**:
- **HIPAA (US)**: 60 million patient records affected, OCR investigation launched
- **GDPR (EU)**: 150 million EU patient records, €4B potential fine
- **PIPEDA (Canada)**: 25 million records, Privacy Commissioner investigation
- **38 other countries**: Various privacy laws triggered simultaneously

**Legal Complications**:

- ICU patients require real-time monitoring data integration

**Technical Recovery Options**:
1. **Pay Ransom**: Fastest recovery but sets precedent and may violate laws
2. **Restore from Backups**: 48-72 hour process, some data loss inevitable
3. **Partial System Recovery**: Prioritize life-critical systems first
4. **Manual Operations**: Continue with paper systems while rebuilding

**Stakeholder Pressure**:
- **Hospital CEOs**: "Patients are dying - pay whatever it takes"
- **Government Regulators**: "Ransom payments fund terrorism - absolutely prohibited"
- **Insurance Companies**: "Payment voids your cyber insurance coverage"
- **Medical Staff**: "We can't treat patients safely without their data"

#### Challenge 2: International Regulatory Coordination
**Conflicting Legal Requirements**:
- **US Treasury (OFAC)**: Ransom payments to sanctioned entities prohibited
- **EU Data Protection Authorities**: 72-hour breach notification deadline
- **UK Information Commissioner**: Demanding detailed forensic analysis
- **Canadian Privacy Commissioner**: Requiring immediate patient notification
- **Australian Privacy Commissioner**: Investigating cross-border data transfers

**Regulatory Coordination Challenges**:
- Different notification timelines across jurisdictions
- Conflicting requirements for forensic evidence preservation
- Varying patient notification and consent requirements
- International cooperation needed for cybercriminal investigation

#### Challenge 3: Technical Recovery Under Pressure
**Infrastructure Assessment**:

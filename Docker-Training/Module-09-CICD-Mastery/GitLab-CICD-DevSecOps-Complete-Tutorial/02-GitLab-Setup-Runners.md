### **Runner Registration Process**

```bash
# GitLab Runner installation and registration process
# ‚Üë Complete process for setting up GitLab runners

# Step 1: Install GitLab Runner on your infrastructure
curl -L "https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/runner/gitlab-runner/script.deb.sh" | sudo bash
# ‚Üë Downloads and executes GitLab's official installation script
# This adds GitLab's package repository to your system
# Enables automatic updates and security patches

sudo apt-get install gitlab-runner
# ‚Üë Installs GitLab Runner package from official repository
# Creates gitlab-runner user and service
# Sets up systemd service for automatic startup

# Step 2: Register runner with GitLab instance
sudo gitlab-runner register
# ‚Üë Interactive registration process that connects runner to GitLab
# Prompts for GitLab URL, registration token, and configuration
# Creates runner configuration in /etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml

# Registration parameters explained:
# GitLab instance URL: https://gitlab.com (for GitLab.com) or your self-hosted URL
# Registration token: Found in GitLab UI ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí CI/CD ‚Üí Runners
# Description: Human-readable name for the runner
# Tags: Labels for job targeting (e.g., "docker", "production", "linux")
# Executor: How jobs are executed (docker, kubernetes, shell, etc.)

  - build                               # Stage 2: Execute optimized builds
  - test                                # Stage 3: Test built artifacts
  - package                             # Stage 4: Create deployment packages

**🔍 Multi-Stage Build Analysis:**

**Stage 1 (Dependencies):**
- **Purpose**: Install production dependencies only
- **Optimization**: Cached layer, rebuilds only when package.json changes
- **Security**: Excludes development tools from production image
- **Size Impact**: Reduces final image size by ~40%

**Stage 2 (Builder):**
- **Purpose**: Build application with development tools
- **Optimization**: Includes build tools but doesn't ship them to production
- **Testing**: Runs unit tests during build to catch issues early
- **Artifacts**: Creates built application files

**Stage 3 (Production):**
- **Purpose**: Minimal runtime environment
- **Security**: Non-root user, minimal packages, no build tools
- **Performance**: Smallest possible image for faster deployments
- **Maintenance**: Only includes what's needed to run the application

**🌟 Why Multi-Stage Builds Matter:**
- **Security**: Smaller attack surface, no development tools in production
- **Performance**: Faster deployments, less network transfer, quicker startup
- **Cost**: Smaller images reduce storage and bandwidth costs
- **Reliability**: Fewer components mean fewer potential failure points

**🔍 Blue-Green Deployment Analysis:**

**Deployment Process:**
1. **Environment Detection**: Automatically determines current active environment
2. **Parallel Deployment**: Deploy to inactive environment while active serves traffic
3. **Health Validation**: Comprehensive health checks before traffic switch
4. **Traffic Switch**: Instant switch via service selector update
5. **Cleanup**: Scale down old environment but keep for rollback

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **Zero Downtime**: Traffic switch is instantaneous
- **Instant Rollback**: Can revert in under 2 minutes
- **Health Validation**: Multiple health checks prevent bad deployments
- **Gradual Validation**: Wait period allows monitoring before full commitment

**🌟 Why Blue-Green Deployment Is Enterprise-Standard:**
- **Business Continuity**: Zero downtime maintains revenue and user experience
- **Risk Management**: Instant rollback capability minimizes business impact
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive health checks prevent bad deployments
- **Operational Excellence**: Predictable, repeatable deployment process

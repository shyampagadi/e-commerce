## 🏗️ Production-Ready Workflow Patterns

### **Robust Error Handling**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/production-ready-pipeline.yml
# ↑ Workflow demonstrating production-ready patterns and error handling
# Includes retry mechanisms, comprehensive logging, and failure recovery

name: Production-Ready Pipeline
# ↑ Descriptive name for production-grade CI/CD workflow

on:
  # ↑ Defines when production pipeline should execute
  push:
    # ↑ Runs when code is pushed to repository
    branches: [main]
    # ↑ Only runs for main branch (production deployments)
    # Production pipelines should be more conservative about when they run

jobs:
  # ↑ Section defining workflow jobs
  build-with-resilience:
    # ↑ Job demonstrating resilient build patterns
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # ↑ Uses Ubuntu virtual machine
    
    steps:
      # ↑ Sequential tasks with production-ready error handling
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        # ↑ Downloads repository source code
        with:
          # ↑ Checkout configuration for production builds
          fetch-depth: 1
          # ↑ Only downloads latest commit (not full history)
          # Faster checkout for production builds where history isn't needed
          
      - name: Setup with Retry
        # ↑ Demonstrates retry pattern for unreliable operations
        uses: nick-fields/retry@v2
        # ↑ Third-party action that adds retry capability to any command
        # Critical for production: network operations can be unreliable
        with:
          # ↑ Retry configuration parameters
          timeout_minutes: 10
          # ↑ Maximum time to wait for each attempt
          # Prevents hanging on slow network operations
          max_attempts: 3
          # ↑ Maximum number of retry attempts
          # Balances reliability with build time
          command: |
            # ↑ Command to execute with retry logic
            npm ci
            # ↑ npm ci can fail due to network issues, registry problems
            # Retry makes builds more reliable in production environments
            
      - name: Build with Error Context
        # ↑ Demonstrates comprehensive error handling and debugging
        run: |
          # ↑ Shell script with advanced error handling
          set -e
          # ↑ Exit immediately if any command fails
          # Ensures build fails fast on first error
          
          echo "::group::Building application"
          # ↑ GitHub Actions grouping for collapsible log sections
          # Makes logs more readable by organizing related output
          
          if ! npm run build; then
            # ↑ Conditional execution - runs diagnostic commands if build fails
            # ! negates the exit code (true if npm run build fails)
            
            echo "::error::Build failed - checking common issues"
            # ↑ ::error:: is GitHub Actions annotation syntax
            # Creates error annotation visible in workflow summary
            
            # Collect diagnostic information for troubleshooting
            echo "Node version: $(node --version)"
            # ↑ Shows Node.js version for compatibility debugging
            echo "NPM version: $(npm --version)"
            # ↑ Shows npm version for package manager debugging
            echo "Available memory: $(free -h)"
            # ↑ Shows memory usage - builds can fail due to memory constraints
            # -h flag shows human-readable format (GB, MB)
            echo "Disk space: $(df -h)"
            # ↑ Shows disk usage - builds can fail due to insufficient space
            # df -h shows filesystem usage in human-readable format
            
            exit 1
            # ↑ Explicitly exit with failure code
            # Ensures workflow fails after collecting diagnostic info
          fi
          
          echo "::endgroup::"
          # ↑ Closes the log group started above
          
      - name: Upload Build Artifacts
        # ↑ Saves build outputs and logs for debugging
        if: always()
        # ↑ Runs this step even if previous steps failed
        # Critical: we want logs even when builds fail
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        # ↑ Official GitHub action for uploading files
        with:
          # ↑ Artifact upload configuration
          name: build-logs
          # ↑ Name of artifact (appears in GitHub UI)
          path: |
            # ↑ Multi-line YAML for multiple file patterns
            npm-debug.log*
            # ↑ npm debug logs (created when npm commands fail)
            # * wildcard matches any npm debug log files
            build.log
            # ↑ Custom build log file (if your build process creates one)
            .npm/_logs/
            # ↑ npm's internal log directory
            # Contains detailed information about npm operations
```

**Detailed Production-Ready Patterns for Newbies:**

1. **Retry Mechanisms:**
   - **Network Reliability**: Internet connections can be unreliable in CI environments
   - **Registry Issues**: Package registries (npm, PyPI) sometimes have outages
   - **Transient Failures**: Temporary issues that resolve on retry
   - **Exponential Backoff**: Some retry actions include intelligent delay patterns

2. **Error Handling Strategy:**
   - **Fail Fast**: `set -e` stops execution on first error
   - **Diagnostic Collection**: Gather information when failures occur
   - **Context Preservation**: Save logs and artifacts for post-mortem analysis
   - **Graceful Degradation**: Continue with cleanup even after failures

3. **GitHub Actions Annotations:**
   - **::error::**: Creates error annotations visible in workflow summary
   - **::warning::**: Creates warning annotations
   - **::notice::**: Creates informational annotations
   - **::group::** / **::endgroup::**: Creates collapsible log sections

4. **Artifact Management:**
   - **Always Upload**: Use `if: always()` to save artifacts even on failure
   - **Debugging Aid**: Logs help diagnose issues in failed builds
   - **Retention**: Artifacts kept for configured period (default 90 days)
   - **Download Access**: Team members can download artifacts for analysis

5. **Production Considerations:**
   - **Conservative Triggers**: Only run on main branch for production
   - **Resource Monitoring**: Check memory and disk space proactively
   - **Timeout Management**: Prevent builds from hanging indefinitely
   - **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting production issues

### **Comprehensive Monitoring**

            start = datetime.fromisoformat(data['run_started_at'].replace('Z', '+00:00'))
            end = datetime.fromisoformat(data['updated_at'].replace('Z', '+00:00'))
            duration = (end - start).total_seconds()

            # Alert if pipeline too slow
            if duration > 600:  # 10 minutes

## 🔧 Common Issues and Solutions

### **Dependency Management Issues**

```yaml
# Solution: Robust dependency handling
- name: Handle Dependencies Safely
  run: |
    # Clear npm cache if corrupted
    if ! npm ci; then
      echo "NPM install failed, clearing cache..."
      npm cache clean --force
      rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
      npm install
    fi
    
    # Verify critical dependencies
    npm ls --depth=0 || echo "Dependency tree has issues"
```

### **Resource Constraints**

```yaml
# Solution: Resource monitoring and optimization
- name: Monitor Resources
  run: |
    echo "Available resources:"
    echo "Memory: $(free -h | grep Mem | awk '{print $7}')"
    echo "Disk: $(df -h / | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}')"
    echo "CPU cores: $(nproc)"
    
    # Adjust based on available resources
    if [ $(free -m | grep Mem | awk '{print $7}') -lt 1000 ]; then
      echo "Low memory detected, reducing parallel processes"
      export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=512"
    fi
```

### **Network and Timeout Issues**

```yaml
# Solution: Retry mechanisms and timeouts
- name: Network Operations with Retry
  uses: nick-fields/retry@v2
  with:
    timeout_minutes: 5
    max_attempts: 3
    retry_on: error
    command: |
      curl -f --connect-timeout 30 --max-time 300 \
        https://api.external-service.com/data

## 🎯 Performance Optimization Patterns

### **Caching Best Practices**

```yaml
- name: Optimized Caching Strategy
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.npm
      node_modules
      .next/cache

      matrix:
        node-version: [16, 18, 20]
        test-type: [unit, integration]
        exclude:
          - node-version: 16
            test-type: integration  # Skip slow combinations
```

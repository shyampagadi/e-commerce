## 🤔 Why Advanced Docker Matters

### **The Gap Between Intermediate and Expert**

After Module 6, you can deploy production applications with Docker Compose. But enterprise environments require deeper expertise:

```yaml
# What you can do now (Intermediate):
version: '3.8'
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production

# What enterprises need (Expert):
services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.prod
      target: production
    deploy:
      replicas: 5
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 1G
          cpus: '1.0'
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.labels.tier == api
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
    logging:
      driver: fluentd
      options:
        fluentd-address: logs.company.com:24224
    networks:
      - api_tier
    secrets:
      - jwt_secret
    configs:
      - source: app_config
        target: /app/config.json
```
